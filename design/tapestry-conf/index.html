          <h1>Notes From Tapestry 2013</h1>
          <div class='date'>28 February 2013</div>
          <p>Yesterday I had the immense pleasure of joining about 100 other
          designers, programmers, educators, data scientists, journalists and
          storytellers in a day-long conference "designed to advance interactive
          online storytelling with data."</p>
          
          <p>Below is a list of links to many of the presentation examples followed
          by notes on the presentations.
          <a href="https://github.com/flyingmachine/nanoc-blog/tree/master/content/design/tapestry-conf.md">You might like the way it's presented on github</a>
          better - my blog isn't ideal for this kind of content.</p>
          
          <p>If you'd like to make any contributions
          or corrections, please leave a comment, tweet me @nonrecursive, or

          <ul>
          <li>When we tell stories we adjust them based on audience - can't do
          that with a graphic</li>
          <li>Have an audience
          
          <ul>
          <li>He partitions his audience into reader viewer listener user</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Focus on the people rather than the mechanism/content delivery vehicle</li>
          <li>A colleague think s of designing for bart simpsons vs lisa simpsons
          
          <ul>
          <li>quick overview (Bart) vs ability to deep dive (Lisa)</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>three types of people (science graphics)
          
          <ul>
          <li>high school science student</li>
          <li>busy commuter - how to keep them interested instead of going to
          their phone, playing a game</li>
          <li>his grandmother - does it pull together as a cohesive visual whole?</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>whole goal is to design for someone else</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>tensions
          
          <ul>
          <li>oversimplification vs. overwhelming detail</li>
          <li>explanation vs. decoration</li>
          <li>storytelling vs interactivity - narrative vs exploration</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>don't be your own audience</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>show ideas + evidence</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>understand, translate, display, explain</li>
          <li>find the central idea. find one idea to use as the basis for your graphic</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>respect the reader - help them through the story</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>allow for multiple entry points - compartmentalized graphical sections</li>
          <li>interactive tools to allow reader to pace themselves through</li>
          <li>use disparate scales to give context. Example, mixing
          longjump distances with free-throw line</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>add meaningful annotations</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>close proximity between graphics and labels</li>
          <li>don't make people go back and forth between graphics and labels</li>
          <li>another way to provide context</li>
          <li>example: annotate each step in a sequence. flea jumping </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>show change</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>motion</li>
          <li>show large scale, small scale what's happening each step</li>
          <li>change in form is another kind of change</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>reduce complexity and opportunities for confusion</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>adding interface can be adding complexity</li>

          </li>
          <li>
          <p>reduce tedium</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>interact with data, not the interface</li>
          <li>strip out tedious activities - usability</li>

          <li>add enough information beyond your visualization to explain a pattern in data</li>

          <ul>
          <li>motion is fleeting and transient</li>
          <li>cannot simultaneously attend to multiple animations</li>
          <li>... more</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Pat showed the animation of the algorithm, but it didn't really
          explain how the algorim worked</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>I had trouble thinking of what to note for this one, would greatly
          appreciate contributions here.</p>
          
          <h2>Choosing the Right Visual Story, Cheryl Phillips</h2>
          
          <p>Side note: This seemed mostly aimed at journalists.</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>What's the story?
          
          <ul>
          <li>data without a theme is just a bunch of data - not a story</li>
          <li>who what when where why how - oldies but goodies</li>
          <li>interview your data. think of it as the man on the street. keep
          asking it questions</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>avoid "notebook dump"
          
          <ul>
          <li>don't put every last detail in the story</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>use the nutgraf (theme) to help define a strong visualization</li>
          <li>data is more than numbers -- what little stories make up the larger whole which can be visualized?
          
          <ul>
          <li>example: methadone the politics of pain</li>
          <li>example: family tree of songlaw</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>29, Nigel Holmes</h2>
          
          <p>My sparse notes here don't really do the talk justice, probably
          because I was enthralled with the presentation. Especially Nigel
          attempting the long jump - I doubt any of us will forget seeing that!</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>29 is not interesting in itself, but interesting in context</li>
          <li>you understand something when you see it next to something you already something understand</li>
          <li>context is the key to understanding</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>The Art of Honest Theft: Evolution of a connected scatterplot, Hannah Fairfield</h2>
          
          <ul>
          <li>How graphics influence each other</li>
          <li>if you move away from plotting time against the horizontal you can
          reveal interesting trends</li>

            reader is reading at that moment <em>(this idea shows up a lot during the conf)</em>

          <li>nick felt (?) was inspiration</li>
          <li>is a critic on the why axis, but doesn't mean that in a negative way</li>
          <li>"the finished piece frequently acts as a seductive screen that
          distracts us from the higher level of investigation"</li>
          <li>move past being psychics into being an investigator: as a critic,
          move from guessing to asking</li>
          <li>once you know the objective of the visualization you're able to
          judge whether it succeeded or failed</li>

          <h2>Visual storytelling in the Age of Data, Robert Kosara</h2>
          
          <ul>
          <li>academics don't get the idea of presenting data, communicating data. it's just an afterthought</li>
          <li>argues that stylizing charts is quite useful. helps to tell the
          story. emotional impact?

          <li>example: monstrous data by Nigel Holmes</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>there's a danger to telling stories</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>can lead you down the wrong path</li>
          </ul>

          <li>as storytellers, you want your audience to lose themselves in the story

          <li>all narrative art forms are based on extremely simple principles</li>
          <li>in comics: space = time</li>

          <li>a noble impulse</li>
          <li>but at the same time there are art forms which are fixed. comics is one of them</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>the form matters!

          </li>
          <li>when you have violent shifts in the landscape, the only thing you can do is hold on to basic principles
