          <h1>A Philosophy of Programming, Rough Sketch</h1>
          <div class='date'>05 January 2012</div>
          <p>Below is a first attempt at describing an integrated approach to
          programming. My hope is that it'll give programmers some tools to
          reason about their current practices and generate ideas on new
          practices to implement.</p>
          
          <p>The unifying idea is that our work is governed by cognitive processes
          and that we can better understand our work by understanding those
          processes. There is a wealth of information available on such topics
          as memory, attention, focus, and emotion, and I believe that it will
          be fruitful to relate such information directly to the processes
          involved in programming.</p>
          
          <p>Put another way, understanding our hardware will help us understand
          the behavior of our software.</p>
          
          <p>There are a lot of gaps. My hope is that I'll get a lot of feedback
          that will help me fill in those gaps.</p>
          
          <h2>The Processes</h2>
          
          <p>There are three main processes involved in programming:</p>
          
          <ol>
          <li>Learning</li>
          <li>Problem Solving</li>
          <li>Social interaction</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>This article only addresses learning. Future articles will address
          the other two topics.</p>
          
          <h2>Learning</h2>
          
          <p>We constantly need to learn: existing codebases, new libraries, the problem
          domain, the application environment.</p>
          
          <p>Learning consists of relating new information to existing knowledge.</p>
          
          <h2>Memory</h2>
          
          <p>Ease of learning is in part determined by short term memory. To learn,
          it is necessary to hold multiple mental objects in short term memory in
          order to compare them to each other and discover the relationships
          between them.</p>
          
          <p>Not all mental objects are created equal. Some take up more "space"
          than others. Familiar objects take up less space than unfamiliar
          objects. For example, the following list is relatively easy to hold in
          memory:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>bed</li>
          <li>cup</li>
          <li>light</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The following list is harder to hold in memory:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>clorp</li>
          <li>farg</li>
          <li>dwesh</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Short term memory also has a temporal limitation (obviously). We
          should avoid creating the need to hold objects in memory for longer
          than our brains are designed for. We've all experienced the strain
          produced by having to navigate back and forth among multiple files in
          order to figure something out. More on this later.</p>
          
          <h3>Naming</h3>
          
          <p>The nature of memory explains why it is necessary to name things well
          in code. The explanation is two-fold (using method names as an
          example):</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Without proper naming, it is more likely to be necessary to derive
          the behavior of a method from its constituent parts. This requires
          loading more items into your short-term memory, possibly resulting
          in your forgetting why you were looking at the method in the first
          place. The result is that learning time is increased.</li>
          <li>Indescript names also take up more "space" in short term memory,
          making it more difficult to understand how a method relates to the
          larger system.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Examples needed.</p>
          
          <h3>Metaphor</h3>
          
          <p>Metaphor is at the heart of programming: stacks, queues, pipes,
          memory, objects, domain models. These are all metaphors. 
          Metaphor is at the heart of our craft.</p>
          
          <p>We also use the term "abstraction", but I think "metaphor" is better
          when it comes to naming, as it more directly denotes that we are
          relating new concepts to existing concepts. But the distinction really
          doesn't matter.</p>
          
          <p>Good metaphors allow us to hold more information-dense items in
          memory. They provide more "hooks" which allow for easier retrieval
          from long-term memory.</p>
          
          <p>Other "metaphors":</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Visual form of code. Indentiation stands for hierarchy.</li>
          <li>Code colorization. Color stands for syntax.</li>
          <li>Programming style. Shared programming style allows people to derive
          meaning from the structure of the code.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>All of these examples of metaphor reduce the number of mental objects
          we need to retain in short-term memory, thus making learning easier.
          You can easily confirm that it's much easier to hold "stack" in memory
          than it is to hold "a last in, first out abstract data type and linear
          data structure."</p>
          
          <h3>Visual Aids</h3>
          
          <p>Visual aids are information-dense. Our visual brains are pretty
          awesome at processing visual aids. My little treatise on visual
          design: <a href="http://www.visualmess.com">Clean Up Your Mess</a>.</p>
          
          <h3>Documentation</h3>
          
          <p>API documentation is not enough. People who use your code have the
          following questions, among others:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>What is the purpose of the system?</li>
          <li>What are the subsystems, and what are their purposes?</li>
          <li>How do the parts interact?</li>
          <li>How do I extend it?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>It's not reasonable to expect someone to answer these questions by
          reading code and API documentation. Because there are so many pieces
          involved, it is very difficult for someone to a) determine which
          pieces are relevant and b) hold the relevant pieces in mind long
          enough to deduce the answer to his question. Such a process often
          involves navigating multiple files, constantly having to refresh our
          memories by looking at the same pieces of code over and over.</p>
          
          <p>It's possible to answer questions like the ones listed above using the
          process I listed above, but it's not optimal. Good documentation
          condenses the information, making it understandable without producing
          so much cognitive load.</p>
          
          <p>Examples of good documentation:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>
          <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/">nanoc</a>. It was very easy to learn
          how to use nanoc because the documentation is excellent. If I had to
          learn how to use it by reading the code, I wouldn't have bothered.
          If I had to learn solely by going through examples, it would still
          have been very difficult. Instead, the documentation provides a
          mixture of prose and examples which made learning the system very
          easy.</li>
          <li>
          <a href="http://www.whoopsapp.com/">Whoops</a>. Well, maybe I'm being a little
          vain and/or delusional here, but I think my documentation for Whoops
          is above-average. There's still a good amount that I could cover,
          though.</li>
          </ul>

          documentation</a></p>
          
          <h2>Learning Skills</h2>
          
          <h3>Describe What You Don't Know</h3>
          
          <p>Being able to concretely determine what it is you need to know is of
          great value. Learn to quickly transform the emotion of confusion into
          a concrete statement of what you need to learn.</p>
          
          <h3>Ask About it Directly</h3>
          
          <p>Often, when seeking help, we ask the wrong question. Need examples.</p>
          
          <h3>Confirm Your Knowledge</h3>
          
          <p>State and restate what you think you know to someone else who can tell
          you whether you're wrong. Often, we make a lot of unconscious
          assumptions when trying to learn, and this process will help you
          uncover those assumptions.</p>
          
          <h2>To explore</h2>
          
          <ul>
          <li>How does emotional state affect learning?</li>
          <li>How is emotion related to certrainty?</li>
          <li>What is the relationship between testing, memory, and learning?</li>
          <li>How can teams support learning?</li>
          <li>Find concrete examples of codebases which support learning</li>
          <li>How information navigation is related to learning, e.g. including a 
          table of contents in documentation</li>
          </ul>
