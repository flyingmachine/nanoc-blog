          <h1>Daily Gratitude</h1>
          <div class='date'>16 October 2012</div>
          <p>Around the beginning of the year I read about the benefits of
          cultivating a daily practice of gratitude. Making a point of being
          grateful trains you to think more positively and just makes you feel
          better.</p>
          
          <p>I've personally found it to be a rewarding, easy practice. Every
          morning I think about three things that I'm grateful for as soon as I
          wake up, and it's a fantastic way to start the day. And over the past
          six months, I've found myself feeling grateful for my life much more
          often.</p>
          
          <p>The fact is, I have a great life. I do what I love, I'm with the woman
          I love, and I'm financially secure. Now I appreciate my great
          situation much more than I did six months ago.</p>
          
          <p>And if there's something in my life I want to change, practicing
          gratitude has helped to give me the energy to change it. Instead of
          feeling overwhelmed and anxious, I feel like I ultimately have nothing
          to worry about.</p>
          
          <p>The best part about it is that it's freaking easy and only takes a few
          minutes, but the benefits are huge and accumulate over time. It's
          such a powerful practice that I truly think everyone should try it.
          Here are a couple suggestions for getting started:</p>
          
          <h2>What you don't lack</h2>
          
          <p>It's easy to take our everyday lives for granted. If you have a
          toothache, you are grateful when it's gone. But you quickly adjust to
          your new situation and forget that your tooth is better.</p>
          
          <p>But when you look closely, you can see that our everyday lives are
          full of small miracles like these. Do you have food? Do you have your
          vision? Your hearing? None of these are guaranteed to anyone.</p>
          
          <p>As Thich Nhat Hanh put it:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>For me, to be alive is a miracle. It is the greatest of all
          miracles. To feel that you are alive and are breathing in is to
          perform a miracle - one that you can perform at any time.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Or think about this. There's a condition called "alien hand syndrome"
          where those who suffer from it can't control one of their hands. They
          try to button up their shirt with one hand, and the other hand
          unbuttons it. They move in to hug a loved one, only to have the alien
          hand punch the person. Not having alien hand syndrome is something to
          be grateful for.</p>
          
          <h2>Your past</h2>
          
          <p>Is there anyone in your past that helped you when you needed it?</p>
          
          <p>Did you have good friends? A family that loved you?</p>
          
          <p>Even if you are feeling a lack in your life now, you can be grateful
          for what you've had in the past. Even if it's difficult, trying
          feeling grateful for people or events in your past.</p>
          
          <p>These two sources - your past and what you don't lack - can be very
          fruitful sources of gratefulness.</p>
