          <h1>On Learning Skills (A Response to Move Your Feet)</h1>
          <div class='date'>27 August 2012</div>
          <p>Matt Swanson wrote an inspiring
          <a href="http://swanson.github.com/blog/2012/08/27/move-your-feet.html">blog post</a>
          on learning new skills and developing new habits. Below is additional
          information that could help you learn a new programming skill or
          develop a new programming habit, along with additional resources.
          Here's the summary:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Programming is a skill
          
          <ul>
          <li>You need practice as well knowledge</li>
          <li>Learning can be seen as a process of bridging your gaps</li>
          <li>Performing a new skill requires you to develop new habits, and
          the rules for forming habits apply</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>There are many things you can do to successfully create a new habit
          
          <ul>
          <li>Social support</li>
          <li>Environmental support</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Programming is a skill</h2>
          
          <p>Programming is a skill, which means that learning programming
          languages and techniques is not as simple as accumulating facts.
          No written guide to programming, no matter how thorough, will ever be
          sufficient because there are countless details which have to be left
          out, details which you can only assimilate while engaging in the
          practice of programming.</p>
          
          <p>No one would suggest that you could become a world-class singer by
          merely going through a book on the subject. With these physical
          skills, it's obvious that learning involves doing something other than
          just absorbing knowledge. I think that, with programming, its nature
          as a skill is often overlooked because it's knowledge work. The key
          thing to keep in mind is that you must actually do programming in
          order to learn languages and techniques.</p>
          
          <p>In Matt's case, he was also trying to develop a new habit - using TDD.
          Many aspects of programming are like this. Perhaps you want to start
          documenting your code more or you want to start doing daily standup
          with your team or <em>whatever</em>. These are all habits, some involving
          just you and some involving your team or organization. Recognizing
          them as habits will allow you to apply techniques for successfully
          developing a new habit.</p>
          
          <p>One habit that you can start developing now is to identify your
          learning gaps
          (This list, by the way, is pulled in part from
          <a href="http://amzn.to/1Ww8EGk">Design for How People Learn</a>):</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Knowledge
          
          <ul>
          <li>What information do you need to be successful?</li>
          <li>Where kind you find this information?</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Skill
          
          <ul>
          <li>What will you need to practice to develop the desired
          proficiency?</li>
          <li>How can you make opportunities for practice?</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Motivation
          
          <ul>
          <li>How do you actually feel about learning the skill?</li>
          <li>Do you feel resistant to changing?</li>
          <li><a href="/essays/how-to-get-and-stay-motivated/">More on motivation</a></li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Environment
          
          <ul>
          <li>Do you have all the tools you need?</li>
          <li>Are they within easy reach? For example - if you want to run
          like Matt, are your shoes in your closet or right by your bed so
          that you can put them on first thing in the morning?</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Programming is comprised of habits</h2>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>I'm not a great programmer, I'm a pretty good programmer with great
          habits</p>
          
          <p>-- Kent Beck</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>There's a mountain of text out there on how to form habits. Here's my
          contribution to that mountain!</p>
          
          <h3>Get Social Support</h3>
          
          <p>Enlist your coworkers. Go to hackfests. Changing your habits is way,
          way easier when you have other people supporting you.</p>
          
          <h3>Environmental Support</h3>
          
          <p>Change your environment to make your new habit <em>easy</em> to do and
          antagonistic habits <em>hard</em> to do. As I mentioned above - put your
          running shoes by your bed.</p>
          
          <p>When it comes to programming - change your environment to support your
          new habits. When I started learning Clojure, I invested a lot of
          effort up front in making it painless to actually run Clojure code
          because I knew that otherwise it would be too easy to just tell myself
          "meh, I'll get to this later. Now, time to learn angular.js!" or
          something like that.</p>
          
          <h3>Develop Motivation</h3>
          
          <p>I have a <a href="/essays/how-to-get-and-stay-motivated/">little essay</a> on
          this topic.</p>
          
          <p>Finally,
          <a href="http://amzn.to/1Ww8ONY">"Change Anything"</a>
          is probably the best book I've read on developing new habits.</p>
          
          <p>I hope you find this helpful!</p>
