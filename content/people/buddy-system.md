# The Buddy System

My time at [Reify Health](https://www.reifyhealth.com/) was one of the highlights of my career.

This here doc outlines a proposal for a buddy system. The main idea behind the buddy system is for us to support each other by regularly spending time chatting with each other about things beyond whatever PT story is at hand. Exactly what that looks like will be up to you; this doc includes suggestions for how to have rewarding conversations. First, here are some ground rules:


## Ground Rules

1. It‚Äôs confidential. Whatever you talk about remains between you and your buddy unless you say otherwise. This is meant to provide each other with time and space to speak about what‚Äôs going on :D
2. It‚Äôs completely voluntary. You don‚Äôt have to participate, and if you do participate you can shape it however you want to: the frequency and content of chats is up to you.
3. You can opt out or change buddies whenever you want. If you decide to drop out of the buddy system, it‚Äôs totally up to you if you want to explain why, or not. The buddy system is meant to consciously cultivate a space where we can be vulnerable with each other; part of making that safe is setting the expectation that people can opt out without having to explain why.
4. By the same token, in joining the buddy system you accept that your buddy may at some point wish to opt or change buddies, and you commit to try to not take that personally if it happens üëç
5. Every three months we‚Äôll change buddies - this gives us a chance to grow together, and also a chance to keep getting new perspectives by buddying with other folks on the team.
6. There‚Äôs no impact on your yearly review. Though ‚ÄúBuddy System‚Äù would be a wonderfully Orwellian name for a mandatory chatting initiative.
7. It‚Äôs reciprocal. Buddies commit to listening to and sharing with each other. If you feel like you have room to grow with listening or sharing, that‚Äôs totally cool - and a good first step is to share that with your buddy :)
8. It‚Äôs not hierarchical. Being a Buddy means whole-hearted listening, asking questions, and just being supportive, which is independent of any junior or senior designations.
9. The point is to support each other as human beings, not to meet project objectives :-)

## Suggestions

* Tell your buddy what you want to get out of the buddy system. Do you want to talk about your career? Your goals at Reify? How to improve our architecture? By letting your buddy know what you‚Äôre looking for, you can get all Jerry Maguire and help them help you.
* Listen your asses off. Avoid the urge to give advice unless asked for it, but instead try to truly understand what your buddy is saying, and try to help them gain clarity.
* Potential topics include goal-setting and ‚Äúlife at Reify.‚Äù
  * Goal setting: It can be very useful to talk to someone about your broader goals and to have them hold you accountable. Sharing a goal often makes it more meaningful and gives you more motivation to reach it.
  * Life at Reify: We have retros, which are useful, but regular one-on-one conversations also have a place in supporting each other
* These topic suggestions are not meant to be exhaustive.
* When asking for feedback, communicate what kind of feedback you want:
  * A pat on the back
  * High-level feedback
  * Nitty-gritty feedback

## Notes

Daniel is acting as facilitator in that he‚Äôs organizing discussion about the Buddy System so that we all come to a shared understanding of what it is and what we want to get out of it. However, Daniel isn‚Äôt, like, the Buddy System‚Äôs owner, and can‚Äôt tell you what to do.
