summary: "While at Reify, I drafted an outline of a program called The Buddy System. The idea was to provide a framework for devs to support each other. I'm sharing it here in case others find it useful."

One of my work mottos is "support the hell out of each other": helping
your friends grow and succeed is far more rewarding than chasing after
the next gold star for yourself. While I was at [Reify
Health](https://www.reifyhealth.com/) I was lucky enough to work with
other devs who had a similar ethos. There were no rock stars, and
everyone looked out for each other. I'm happy to have gotten to work
somewhere where I made real, honest-to-god friends :)

During my final weeks there I collaborated with coworkers on an
experimental framework for supporting each other in a formal
context. This framework would let us explore how to be there for each
other in more meaningful ways while maintaining boundaries. This
seemed particularly valuable in Reify's mostly-remote
environment. With their permission, I'm sharing the initial framework
proposal below.

Some reading this might be uncomfortable with the ideas outlined in
the buddy system - and that's totally ok! A key part of the framework
is _you don't have to buy into it_. But I think it speaks volumes
about the level of trust and mutual good feeling among the team that
almost everyone was excited about it while respecting that we're all
different and not everyone prefers the same way of interacting. On the
other hand, new hires were especially excited because they felt like
it would help them acclimate to their new environment. To me, a team
that is enthusiastic about these ideas is a team that I'd want to work
with; it's a team that actually likes the idea of relating to each
other on a real, human level.

One topic that came up was, how is this different from just being
friends? Is it really necessary to have a _structure_ that everyone
agrees to? Does that bring an element of artifice into friendship? My
thinking is that structure is a precondition for
vulnerability. Structure tells us to be extra mindful in how we
interact with each other, and it provides boundaries (like a clear
time limit) to protect us from getting overwhelmed. By designating a
time and place to consciously interact with each other, it also
resolves the problem of never knowing when is "the right time" to
bring something up.

This would be helpful for new hires, sure, but even in my personal
life I've found that structure is much better at fostering deeper
interactions than just winging it. Knowing that everyone is "in it"
together _and_ that "it" won't last forever provides a solid
foundation for trust.

Final note: vulnerability here does _not_ mean you have to spill your
guts, emotionally leaking on each other all the time. It _does_ mean
feeling safe to express that you're struggling or that you feel
dissatisfied or hurt in some way.

Without further ado, here it is:

## The Buddy System

This doc outlines a proposal for a buddy system. The main idea behind the buddy system is for us to support each other by regularly spending time chatting with each other about things beyond whatever story is at hand. Exactly what that looks like will be up to you; this doc includes suggestions for how to have rewarding conversations. First, here are some ground rules:


## Ground Rules

1. It‚Äôs confidential. Whatever you talk about remains between you and your buddy unless you say otherwise. This is meant to provide each other with time and space to speak about what‚Äôs going on :D
2. It‚Äôs completely voluntary. You don‚Äôt have to participate, and if you do participate you can shape it however you want to: the frequency and content of chats is up to you.
3. You can opt out or change buddies whenever you want. If you decide to drop out of the buddy system, it‚Äôs totally up to you if you want to explain why, or not. The buddy system is meant to consciously cultivate a space where we can be vulnerable with each other; part of making that safe is setting the expectation that people can opt out without having to explain why.
4. By the same token, in joining the buddy system you accept that your buddy may at some point wish to opt or change buddies, and you commit to try to not take that personally if it happens üëç
5. Every three months we‚Äôll change buddies - this gives us a chance to grow together, and also a chance to keep getting new perspectives by buddying with other folks on the team.
6. There‚Äôs no impact on your yearly review. Though ‚ÄúBuddy System‚Äù would be a wonderfully Orwellian name for a mandatory chatting initiative.
7. It‚Äôs reciprocal. Buddies commit to listening to and sharing with each other. If you feel like you have room to grow with listening or sharing, that‚Äôs totally cool - and a good first step is to share that with your buddy :)
8. It‚Äôs not hierarchical. Being a Buddy means whole-hearted listening, asking questions, and just being supportive, which is independent of any junior or senior designations.
9. The point is to support each other as human beings, not to meet project objectives :-)

## Suggestions

* Tell your buddy what you want to get out of the buddy system. Do you want to talk about your career? Your goals at Reify? How to improve our architecture? By letting your buddy know what you‚Äôre looking for, you can get all Jerry Maguire and help them help you.
* Listen your asses off. Avoid the urge to give advice unless asked for it, but instead try to truly understand what your buddy is saying, and try to help them gain clarity.
* Potential topics include goal-setting and ‚Äúlife at Reify.‚Äù
  * Goal setting: It can be very useful to talk to someone about your broader goals and to have them hold you accountable. Sharing a goal often makes it more meaningful and gives you more motivation to reach it.
  * Life at Reify: We have retros, which are useful, but regular one-on-one conversations also have a place in supporting each other
* These topic suggestions are not meant to be exhaustive.
* When asking for feedback, communicate what kind of feedback you want:
  * A pat on the back
  * High-level feedback
  * Nitty-gritty feedback

## Notes

Daniel is acting as facilitator in that he‚Äôs organizing discussion about the Buddy System so that we all come to a shared understanding of what it is and what we want to get out of it. However, Daniel isn‚Äôt, like, the Buddy System‚Äôs owner, and can‚Äôt tell you what to do.

What are your thoughts? Have you tried something like this where you
worked, and how did it go?
