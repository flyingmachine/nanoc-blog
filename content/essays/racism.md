summary: Rambling thoughts on racism from a mixed-race guy who grew up in the South.
---

My first memories of home take place in a two-story welfare housing
unit in Lynchburg, Virginia. I remember lying in bed scared at night
afraid that ninjas were going to climb in through the bedroom window
and slice everyone up. I remember sitting in an upholstered chair with
the stuffing coming out while my mother gave me haircuts and being
afraid that at any second Freddy Kreuger was going to burst through
the seat and end me. I remember standing by an outdoor track with
another ankle biting delinquent and shouting the cuss words she had
taught me, then going home and asking my mom, "What does 'fuck you'
mean?"


I also have a distinct category of memories which I owe to my skin
color and facial structure. My father's American, but my mother is
Vietnamese and I take after her: tan skin, broad face, flat nose, and
dark, bristly hair. As a kid, hearing "ching chong" sung tauntingly or
derisively at me was a regular occurrence, along with questions like
"where you from?" and "you know kung fu?"

So, growing up, I was made aware that I was different from most my
peers. However, I never came to feel like I was _inferior_ to others
because of my race. When the prevailing stereotypes associated with
your phenotype are that you're good at math and you know how to do
jump kicks (both of which became true of me), having your Asian-ness
thrust in your face doesn't really humiliate you. So it's hard to call
what I dealt with racism. My first memories of actual racism are from
high school. I knew people who were angry toward black people, _all_
black people, and spoke of them with complete contempt. Others would
speak of them with mild derision and disgust. One guy I knew had a
seemingly endless supply of "nigger" jokes.

At the time I knew that racism was simply bad, but I didn't fully the
realize the acidic, soul-destroying effect it has. My first inkling
came when I took on a seven-week internship with an organization that
helps at-risk youth. As it turned out, most of these kids came from
poor families, and most of them were black. Many of the kids seemed
pretty normal, but some of them... I don't know how to describe it,
except that elementary school children shouldn't have that much anger.
I'm sure that there were many factors influencing how these kids were
- a fractured family, poverty - but I'm also sure that being told in
subtle and perhaps overt ways that they were worth less than others as
human beings because of something out of their control had an impact
on them too.

My real awakening about the impact of racism came when I read The
Autobiography of Malcolm X. I finally came to really _understand_ that
racism is not just about being called "nigger" or "chink" or "whitey".
It's not just about the daily indignity of being treated as inferior.
It's also about institutional power. Slavery was an institution. Jim
Crow laws were part of our legal institutions. Malcolm X recalls:

> I remember being suddenly snatched awake into a frightening confusion
> of pistol shots and shouting and smoke and flames. My father had
> shouted and shot at the two white men who had set the fire and were
> running away. Our home was burning down around us... The white police
> and firemen came and stood around watching as the house burned down to
> the ground.

I've included a couple more excerpts from The Autobiography of Malcolm
X and from Black Like Me below. Even today, however, it's easy to find
racism in our institutions, even if there's no legal basis:
[blacks being targeted for disenfranchisement](http://www.pbs.org/now/election-2008/question2.html)
or
[not receiving equal treatment under the law](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2008-01-24/news/the-wrong-driver/).

Racism is clearly responsible for some of the most cruel, degrading
treatment humans inflict on each other. About 9 years ago, however, I
read "Everything that Rises Must Converge", a short story by Flannery
O'Connor, and it's made me think. The story takes place in the South
during the civil rights era. One of the main characters says the
following:

> "With the world in the mess it's in," she said, "it's a wonder we can
> enjoy anything. I tell you, the bottom rail is on the top.
> 
> "Of course," she said, "if you know who you are, you can go
> anywhere... Most of them in it are not our kind of people," she said,
> "but I can be gracious to anybody. I know who I am."

One of the major components of her identity is her superiority to
black people. This is still astounding to me - that someone could view
this racist mentality not only as justified, but as an integral part
of who she is.

How does this happen? It's clear that children don't actively choose
to incorporate racism into their identities. Rather, it seems like
identity is like an inner Mr. Potato Head, and some built-in mechanism
plugs in whatever pieces are available from the surrounding culture.
It's also clear to me that this built-in mechanism is completely
amoral, that its purpose is to produce a Head like those it's exposed
to rather than to ensure respect for universal human dignity.

And that really helps me to have empathy for people who act in racist
ways. Abraham Lincoln argues that slaveowners "are just what we would
be in their situations" - an acknowledgement of the overwhelming power
of culture and environment to shape your beliefs and your character.


There's a lot more that I want to write on this subject - for example,
how racism is really just one example of out-group prejudice in the
in-group/out-group paradigm, with other examples including homophobia
and classism. How it's possible for victims of prejudice to justify
their own prejudice (see this article on
[hip hop and homophobia](http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=15116190&blogID=229642761&MyToken=eae2c553-d21f-4e45-b216-4f651977b86a)
.) In fact, I'm sure there's a lot of literature on the subject and if
anyone could point me to it I would appreciate it.



In the mean time, I only want to address two questions:
How difficult is it to change this component of identity?
What happens when this component of identity is challenged?
Lincoln argued that slaveowners "are just what we would be in their situation." (p167)

He had begun to lay away savings for the store he had always wanted to own when, as always, some stupid local Uncle Tom Negroes began to funnel stories about his revolutionary beliefs to the local white people. This time, the get-out-of-town threats came from a local hate society called The Black Legion. They wore black robes instead of white. Soon, nearly everywhere my father went, Black Legionnaires were reviling him as an "uppity nigger" for wanting to own a store, for living outside the Lansing Negro district, for spreading unrest and dissention among "the good niggers."
As in Omaha, my mother was pregnant again, this time with my youngest sister. Shortly after Yvonne was born came the nightmare night in 1929, my earliest vivid memory. I remember being suddenly snatched awake into a frightening confusion of pistol shots and shouting and smoke and flames. My father had shouted and shot at the two white men who had set the fire and were running away. Our home was burning down around us... The white police and firemen came and stood around watching as the house burned down to the ground.

Build a sense of identity on stronger ground.
Have you ever read ? It's a short story by Flannery O'Connor. I finally found it online: . I read it for the first time maybe 8 years ago and it's really stuck with me. It made me realize that racism can be part of someone's very identity. I'm reading The Grapes of Wrath again now, and Steinbeck has the characters talk about how the land is who they are - how the earth where a grandfather got gored by a bull is who they are, how the house where a son is born is who they are, etc. I don't think someone strongly racist would think of himself in those terms. But I think the civil rights movement had the same effect on racist whites that the dustbowl (and consequent having to move) had on Okies. The civil rights movement probably made them feel like a part of who they were was being taken from them. And I guess I see that a lot now, especially when it comes to politics and "hot button issues". The way people act and talk, it looks like they feel the same fear and anger from perceiving that someone's trying to take away a part of who they are. Anyway, the story is really good :).

I've been thinking about the phrase "love the sinner, hate the sin" from a different standpoint. This really all started many years ago when I read a short story, "Everything that Rises Must Converge" (by Flannery O'Connor). One thing I got from the story was that racism can be very much a part of someone's identity - that it can be part of who someone is to consider him/herself better than whole classes of people people just because they belong to a different race.
Recently I started re-reading the Grapes of Wrath, and it describes how the Okies felt like they were losing a part of themselves, losing their sense of their place in the world, when they got pushed off their land. The Flannery O'Connor story made me realize that racism can be just like that. That southern whites probably felt the same sense of loss and disorientation with the changes that the civil rights movement brought.
Personally, I would consider racism a sin. It degrades people in a way that few things can. But what if I had been born to a white family in Alabama in the 1930's? Would I have been out torching black folk's houses? Or would I not have actually *done* anything, but inside harbor a bitterness and an ready contempt for black people? Even Abraham Lincoln said that if he had been born in the South, he would probably think as Southerners did.
So it seems to me that a lot of what we think is right or wrong is bound up in our own personal identities, in our ability to make sense of the world and feel secure in our relations with other people. Some of us get lucky and are born in cultures which overwhelming "tell" individuals that they should relate to each other as equals.
At this point my thinking if pretty fuzzy, and I apologize. The overall gist, though, is that I think it makes sense to "love the sinner" because the command people have over setting their own moral compass is so tenuous, and the ability to act in accordance with it so impeded by other competing human instincts, that I personally have no right to condemn another person for what they've done. What I really mean to say is - I have an obligation to *not* treat others as less than human because they've done something I think is wrong. We're all in the same boat, trying to make sense of the world and be decent people.
