I wrote
[*Clojure for the Brave and True*](http://www.braveclojure.com)
because I feel incredibly grateful for how damn lucky I've been in
life, and I wanted to do something to share...

I think Clojure will be big... It is important, it has great ideas, it
makes programming easier. It's also romantic somehow. It feels
simpler. It has a legacy. Reference dream code. Feels like something
that you can do in your spare time for fun, for the joy of it, except
you can actually get paid to do it. Like a commercial artist who
paints in his free time.

There have been rough times. However, programming has allowed me to
improve my life, despite having no degree etc...

I also get personal fulfillment...




Back in August of 2013 I started writing an
[online book for Clojure noobs](http://www.braveclojure.com/). A
couple times since then, I've been asked why I did that. Now that the
writing is done and the book's [in print](http://amzn.to/1jQXJ8a),
I've decided to break my years of silence on the subject and reveal
what motivated me to commit such an act of prolonged madness.

The short answer is: profound gratitude.
