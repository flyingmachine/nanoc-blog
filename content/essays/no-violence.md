"I hope you had a good time and consider your mother is dead and gone
now," read the email I received from my mom the day after I got
married.

She was supposed to be in Santa Fe with me and wife, but two days
earlier - the day before our wedding - her plane got delayed and then
cancelled. She had called when that happened. While I tried to look up
alternative flights from nearby airports, she angrily accused me of
being selfish and not loving her. (I can still remember the tone of
her voice, a low hiss that held nothing but contempt.) When I told her
we could find another plane to get her there in time for the wedding
she asked, sarcastically, "What's the point?" (We had this
conversation while my wife and I were at the county clerk's office to
get our marriage license. I would excuse myself to talk in the hallway
so no one else would be able to hear my mom.) The last time I heard
from her was a couple months later, when she texted me out of the blue
from an airport: "My plane is delayed, but you don't care."

I'm still working through these final lessons in rage and violence,
despair and guilt, imparted to me by mom. My dad is absent from this
story because I haven't talked to him in more than a decade, but he,
too, has left me a lifetime's instruction. So I'll work through them
the only way I know how: by once again picking up the tools I've found
for growing joy out of so much shit.

This my attempt to work the raw pain of my family's history of
violence into a shape that makes sense. This is my story of how I've
come to commit myself to the ideal of nonviolence and to believe that
the only way to stay sane is to love as many people as you can as hard
as you can for as long as you can.

My mom grew up in Vietnam during its war with America and had many
encounters with its impersonal brutality: once, walking home, she
encountered her best friend's dead body, a bullet hole in the
head. More damaging, though, was the violence at home: parents,
uncles, and aunts, who would make demands, hit her head, call her
names, critize, rarely show love. My father grew up in Missouri, son
to a father who followed the time-honored tradition of coming home
drunk and beating the shit out of his wife and kids.

My brother and I felt the echoes of those blows growing up. We felt
them in the way
