It's 

There's a snow bank in front of our house that makes the street really narrow. Last week my partner Su tried all day to get someone to remove the snow -- to no avail. That night I was helping her get groceries out of the car, parked temporarily in front of the house, and the snow bank made it hard for other cars to pass. She laughingly commented that "now people can't get through!" Besides being unable to finding someone to plow the snow, a lot of other stuff had gone wrong that day, and the best we could do was laugh.

As we were laughing, a driver trying to navigate the narrow street started shouting at us. Su and I took it in stride, until the guy rolled down his window and starting cussing at Su, saying things like "You can't park like that, you dumb bitch". He just wouldn't stop. He parked up the street, got out and continued shouting, even after we told him we were parked there because Su's disabled and that we'd call the police if he didn't stop.

When he finally left I was furious. This was right before heading to aikido practice, so I thought to myself, "OK, what's an aikido way to deal with this?" I ended up going to his house and knocking on his door. He came around the side and grabbed my wrist. I guess my instincts kicked in because the next thing I knew I had him pinned on the icy sidewalk.

... Just kidding! What really happened was, when I knocked on the door, he answered it, and I said something like, "I know that the way we parked made it hard to drive -- in fact, we were about to move the car when you came by. We're sorry it made it hard for you to drive." 

We went back and forth a little, and the guy said he thought Su was laughing at him. When I told him she was laughing at the situation, not at him, he started saying he was sorry over and over, sorry for being a jerk, and I should tell Su he apologized.

We're not inviting the guy over for dinner or anything, but I think the situation was resolved pretty happily. It was pretty awesome to be able to confront the guy in a non-threatening, non-accusatory way, and to have him end up apologizing.
