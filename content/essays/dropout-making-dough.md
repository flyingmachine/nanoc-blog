# On Making $90/hr as a 21-Year-Old High School (and College) Dropout

In 2006 I was 21 years old, living in Hawaii and charging $90 an hour
as a freelance web developer. I had fulfilled my teenaged dream of
being able to do work I love while sitting on a sunny beach and
drinking a delicious, cool drink. And it was exactly as awesome as it
sounds :)

The rest of this post details how I got there with the hope that the
information will be helpful or inspiring for others wanting to work
for themselves. I'll cover the general principles that guided me with
specific examples.

## Principle 1: Reject the Statistical Approach to Planning Your Life

_Brief aside: when I talk about "statistics" in the example below, I am
talking literally about statistics derived from data. However, this
principle applies to our intuitive stats as well. Stats like, "the
likelihood of my landing this gig" which we unconsciously tally based
on the "data" of our observations of ourselves and the world. Brief
aside over! Onward!_

One of my best friends in high school was always consulting statistics
in order to figure out what to do with her life. For example, in
trying to determine what career to go for, she consulted numbers on:

* Career salary ranges
* The employment prospects for that career; that is, the percentage of
  people with a relevant degree who were subsequently employed in that
  field
* The likelihood that she would be able to get the relevant degree,
  including the percent chance that she would be able to get into a
  decent college given her GPA and other credentials

The way I see it, there were two major mistakes with this approach.

### Mistake 1: Treating Statistical Information as Hard Limitations

My friend saw these statistics as immutable laws of the world which
can in no way be defied, like gravity or Nickelback's consummate
inability to produce music. She treated them as the unbreakable
boundaries of her life which she had to work within. She wouldn't even
try to do something that seemed statistically unlikely.

The problem is, life does not unfold in the abstract world of
statistics. You must deal with hard, concrete reality when you're
trying to get your first freelancing gig, or charge a higher rate, or
get into the school you want.

And your success depends completely on your ability to apply your own
brain to the situation ata hand. You do not solve real life problems
statistically. You solve them by working your brain until you come up
with a solution.

And here's the real tragedy of the statistical approach. You undercut
your confidence in your own mind's ability to grasp the world. You rob
yourself of power. By accepting limitations uncritically, as if rules
handed down to you by God, you cut yourself off from the world.

I'm no longer talking literally about math. I'm also talking about
limitations like:

* I might as well not apply to that job because they list a skill I
  don't have (my intuitive statistics says that I'll get rejected
  immediately, so instead of trying to figure out how I can provide
  value I'll give up)
* There's no way I can make money in this economy
* I can't give a public talk even though it would tremendously help my
  career (all my data on myself says that I'm no good at speaking)

The antidote to this approach is embodied in these two quotes from
George Washington Carver:

> Reading about nature is fine, but if a person walks in the woods and
> listens carefully, he can learn more than what is in books.

To me, the first quote says that when it comes to solving a problem -
and making money is all about solving problems - nothing beats
actually going out into the woods yourself.


### Mistake 2: Ignoring Your Inner Voice

> Anything will give up its secrets if you love it enough.

The second quote points to something more profound (incidentally, it's
one of my all time favorite quotes). It points to a beautiful
understanding born of devotion. It points to the joy of learning to
master something, a joy which becomes gratifying in and of itself,
outside of the external rewards it might give you.

But here's something cool. When you are passionate about something and
allow other people to see it, they love it! For one extreme example

By the way, here's a corny joke that I was trying to work in above but
couldn't so I'm hamfistedly cramming it in here:

> Three statisticians went out hunting, and came across a large deer.
> The first statistician fired, but missed, by a meter to the left. The
> second statistician fired, but also missed, by a meter to the right.
> The third statistician didn't fire, but shouted in triumph, "On the
> average we got it!"
