# On Making $90/hr as a 21-Year-Old High School (and College) Dropout

In 2006 I was 21 years old, living in Hawaii and charging $90 an hour
as a freelance web developer. I had fulfilled my teenaged dream of
being able to do work I love while sitting on a sunny beach and
drinking a delicious, cool drink. And it was exactly as awesome as it
sounds :)

The rest of this post details the mindset I had developed to get me to
that point. Hopefully it will be helpful or inspiring for others
wanting to work for themselves. I may provide more concrete info in a
later post.

## Reject the Statistical Approach to Planning Your Life

_Brief aside: when I talk about "statistics" in the example below, I am
talking literally about statistics derived from data. However, this
principle applies to our intuitive stats as well. Stats like, "the
likelihood of my landing this gig" which we unconsciously tally based
on the "data" of our observations of ourselves and the world. Brief
aside over! Onward!_

One of my best friends in high school was always consulting statistics
in order to figure out what to do with her life. For example, in
trying to determine what career to go for, she consulted numbers on:

* Career salary ranges
* The employment prospects for that career; that is, the percentage of
  people with a relevant degree who were subsequently employed in that
  field
* The likelihood that she would be able to get the relevant degree,
  including the percent chance that she would be able to get into a
  decent college given her GPA and other credentials

I think that this approach is fundamentally flawed.

My friend saw these statistics as immutable laws of the world which
can in no way be defied, like gravity or Nickelback's consummate
inability to produce music. She treated them as the unbreakable
boundaries of her life which she had to work within. She wouldn't even
try to do something that seemed statistically unlikely.

## Life Does Not Unfold in the Abstract World of Statistics

The problem is, life does not unfold in the abstract world of
statistics. You must deal with hard, concrete reality when you're
trying to get your first freelancing gig, or charge a higher rate, or
get into the school you want.

And your success depends completely on your ability to apply your own
brain to the situation at hand. You do not solve real life problems
statistically. When driving by a car wreck, you do not say to
yourself, "There's today's one-in-a-thousand! I can totally drive like
an idiot now without getting in a crash!" No, you solve real life
problems by shoving your brain against concrete details until you come
up with a solution.

And here's the real tragedy of the statistical approach. You undercut
your confidence in your own mind's ability to grasp the world. You rob
yourself of power. By accepting limitations uncritically, as if rules
handed down to you by God, you cut yourself off from the world.

I'm no longer talking literally about math. I'm also talking about
limitations like:

* I might as well not apply to that job because they list a skill I
  don't have (my intuitive statistics says that I'll get rejected
  immediately, so instead of trying to figure out how I can provide
  value I'll give up)
* There's no way I can make money in this economy
* I can't give a public talk even though it would tremendously help my
  career (all my data on myself says that I'm no good at speaking)

## The Antidote to This Approach

The antidote to this approach is embodied in these two quotes from
George Washington Carver:

> Reading about nature is fine, but if a person walks in the woods and
> listens carefully, he can learn more than what is in books.

To me, this quote says that when it comes to solving a problem -
and making money is all about solving problems - nothing beats
actually "going out into the woods" yourself.

If you want to be a freelancer, stop giving yourself reasons for why
it won't work and start looking for ways to make it work. I promise
you, this change in mindset makes a world of difference. Instead of
being vaguely aware of all the abstract ways in which you'll fail, you
will encounter concrete problems which you can engage directly and
solve.

Problems like how to find your first client, how to handle billing,
how to scope out your work, and on and on. Name the problem
explicitly, then work to find a solution. Another George Washington
Carver quote:

> Anything will give up its secrets if you love it enough.

And yes, it is scary. Any time you venture into the unknown, you put
yourself at risk. You risk rejection, you risk failure, you risk
financial setback and emotional turmoil. You risk falling in with the
statistical percentage that gets things horribly wrong.

These risks are real, and experiencing them is painful. But making
them the focus of your life is a mistake. It is a mistake to be
concerned first and foremost with protecting yourself.

In the end it comes down to a matter of priorities. Is it more
important to wall yourself away, protecting yourself from pain as much
as possible? Or to embrace the unrepeatable miracle of your life,
engaging fully your own inner voice and the world around you?
