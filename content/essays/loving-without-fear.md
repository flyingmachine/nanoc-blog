# Loving Without Fear

I was sitting at the Cambridge Public Library, and for the first time
in months - years? - I felt at peace. In my journal I had just written
what's become a kind of mantra for me: "Love without fear."

At the time I was going through a very difficult breakup. My
relationship of 6 years had been slowly and painfully dissolving, in
part because of my own inability to end it decisively.

Part of my difficulty what was that I had a lot of guilt over wanting
to end the relationship because the person I was with had a long-term
illness and I was supporting her both financially and as a kind of
house helper or ersatz nurse. I had watched her suffer terribly.

I'm not sure how to convey what that was like. How do you share the
experience of watching someone you love get a spinal tap? Of wheeling
them out of the hospital and to the hotel next door, trying to do it
quickly but smoothly because every bump causes excruciating pain? Or
how about cleaning the vomit out of a mixing bowl because the
antibiotics are causing her nausea? Or giving the antibiotics shots
yourself, night after night? Or knowing that there was no end in
sight?

After six years, I was in a state of chronic exhaustion and stress.
Often I would start my day by sitting at my desk for a couple hours
and just staring, not really able to do anything. I knew that
something had to change, but I felt too guilty to leave.

And, to be completely honest, I was scared about what it might say
about me if I left her. Would it mean that I was a callous, heartless
person? More, I was scared to live without her. We'd been together for
6 years, and the life I knew was familiar and provided comfort in a
way.

But those words, "love without fear", helped give me strength. Beneath
the fear, beneath the raw ache of being a perpetual witness to
suffering, I could still feel the beating heart of love. I felt it
there, ready, waiting for me without judgment. Waiting for me to let
it out again.

The months that followed that day at the library were not easy. 



You will get to a point in your growth where you understand that if you protect yourself, you will never be free. It’s that simple. Because you’re scared, you have locked yourself within your house and pulled down all the shades. Now it’s dark and you want to feel the sunlight, but you can’t. It’s impossible. If you close and protect yourself, you are locking this scared, insecure person within your heart. You will never be free that way.
