# Helpful Communication Patterns

I think it'd be useful to share some communication patterns and see if everyone else finds them useful as well. Their purpose is to help avoid miscommunication. My thinking is that it'd make communication easier if everyone's on the same page, especially since our team is growing.

The following pattern is about requesting help with something. Sometimes I get requests for help (for example, help with a Wallace query) that could be formulated in a way that make it easier for me to help. I know that I definitely make poorly-formed requests all the time. Here's a pattern that I think is useful:

1. It never hurts to start with, "Hey, how's it going?" I've noticed that a lot of folks at McKinsey will do this, and won't continue until the other person has answered. Sravanthi does this, for example, and it comes acress as very polite. This is something I could do better at myself. I neglect to do it sometimes out of impatience.
2. It's also helpful to ask, "Do you have a few minutes to help me out with something?" or even, "I have an urgent problem - could you please help?" Personally, if it's urgent, I would even say "I'm sorry to bother you but I need help - there's a demo in 30 minutes and something's broken." These are all usually better than starting with something like "the thing isn't working."
3. Provide as much information as you can up front. Something like, "I'm having trouble with wallace using tenant X in the NPN environment: (link goes here). When I run a query, I expect X but I get Y. Here's the query:" is very helpful for me. Something like, "wallace is giving me strings when I expect numbers" is much less helpful. I was guilty of doing this today. My request was, "Could you create an NPN account for me?" A better request would have been, "I've tried many things to log in to NPN, and none of them have worked. At this point I think the best strategy is to create an entirely new account. Could you do that for me?"
4. Look out for instances where your interpretation of someone's request diverges from the specific steps they're asking for. For example, you might ask me to re-deploy the Wallace service. I might interpret that as, "Oh, Wallace must be down. You want it running again so I'll run the restart script." In such a case, it'd be useful for me to confirm with you that that's what you're actually asking, as opposed to just going ahead and restarting the service. If I ask a question like, "Is the service down? Would it work for you if I just restart it?" then we can quickly ensure we're on the same page.
5. Don't forget to say thank you :D

I'd love to hear about other common sources of miscommunication and strategies for avoiding them.
