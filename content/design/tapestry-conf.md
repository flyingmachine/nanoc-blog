Yesterday I had the immense pleasure of joining about 100 other
designers, programmers, educators, data scientists, journalists and
storytellers in a day-long conference "designed to advance interactive
online storytelling with data."

Below is a list of links to many of the presentation examples followed
by notes on the presentations.
[You might like the way it's presented on github](https://github.com/flyingmachine/nanoc-blog/tree/master/content/design/tapestry-conf.md)
better - my blog isn't ideal for this kind of content.

or corrections, please leave a comment, tweet me @nonrecursive, or

## Keynote by Jonathan Corum

* When we tell stories we adjust them based on audience - can't do
  that with a graphic
* Have an audience
    * He partitions his audience into reader viewer listener user
* Focus on the people rather than the mechanism/content delivery vehicle
* A colleague think s of designing for bart simpsons vs lisa simpsons
    * quick overview (Bart) vs ability to deep dive (Lisa)
* three types of people (science graphics)
    * high school science student
    * busy commuter - how to keep them interested instead of going to
      their phone, playing a game
    * his grandmother - does it pull together as a cohesive visual whole?
* whole goal is to design for someone else
    * tensions
        * oversimplification vs. overwhelming detail
        * explanation vs. decoration
        * storytelling vs interactivity - narrative vs exploration
    * don't be your own audience

* show ideas + evidence
    * understand, translate, display, explain
    * find the central idea. find one idea to use as the basis for your graphic
* respect the reader - help them through the story
    * allow for multiple entry points - compartmentalized graphical sections
    * interactive tools to allow reader to pace themselves through
    * use disparate scales to give context. Example, mixing
      longjump distances with free-throw line
* add meaningful annotations
    * close proximity between graphics and labels
    * don't make people go back and forth between graphics and labels
    * another way to provide context
    * example: annotate each step in a sequence. flea jumping 
* show change
    * motion
    * show large scale, small scale what's happening each step
    * change in form is another kind of change
* reduce complexity and opportunities for confusion
    * adding interface can be adding complexity
* reduce tedium
    * interact with data, not the interface
    * strip out tedious activities - usability
* visualization is not explanation
    * dont let technology drive
    * add enough information beyond your visualization to explain a pattern in data
    * or structure your visualization to reveal and explain patterns
* reveal patterns
    * layer multiple data sets
* respect the data
    * show what's unique about it
    
      if your visualization can apply to something completely different, you
      might not be telling the unique story. detainees vs cups of tea    
* edit - throw things away.
    * throw as much away as possible but actually tell a story
    * If you're spending most of your time editing you know you're on
      the right track
* apply common sense vigorously

## Showing is Not Explaining, Pat Hanrahan

* trying to explain Euclid's algorithm for Greatest Common Divisor
    * algorithm animation / explanation
* problems with animation
    * motion is fleeting and transient
    * cannot simultaneously attend to multiple animations
    * ... more
* Pat showed the animation of the algorithm, but it didn't really
  explain how the algorim worked

I had trouble thinking of what to note for this one, would greatly
appreciate contributions here.

## Choosing the Right Visual Story, Cheryl Phillips

Side note: This seemed mostly aimed at journalists.

* What's the story?
    * data without a theme is just a bunch of data - not a story
    * who what when where why how - oldies but goodies
    * interview your data. think of it as the man on the street. keep
      asking it questions
* avoid "notebook dump"
    * don't put every last detail in the story
* use the nutgraf (theme) to help define a strong visualization
* data is more than numbers -- what little stories make up the larger whole which can be visualized?
    * example: methadone the politics of pain
    * example: family tree of songlaw
    
## 29, Nigel Holmes

My sparse notes here don't really do the talk justice, probably
because I was enthralled with the presentation. Especially Nigel
attempting the long jump - I doubt any of us will forget seeing that!

* 29 is not interesting in itself, but interesting in context
* you understand something when you see it next to something you already something understand
* context is the key to understanding

## The Art of Honest Theft: Evolution of a connected scatterplot, Hannah Fairfield

* How graphics influence each other
* if you move away from plotting time against the horizontal you can
  reveal interesting trends

  See
  [Driving Shifts Into Reverse](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/business/02metrics.html)
  and
  [Driving Safety, in Fits and Starts](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/17/science/driving-safety-in-fits-and-starts.html)

* what's next?
    * one technique: associate ancillary content (animations) with scroll

      so that extra information shows up in a way that it's tied to what the
      reader is reading at that moment _(this idea shows up a lot during the conf)_
    * focusing on immersive content
    * it's important to carve out time, even just 10%, to play

## The Why Axis, Bryan Connor

* nick felt (?) was inspiration
* is a critic on the why axis, but doesn't mean that in a negative way
* "the finished piece frequently acts as a seductive screen that
  distracts us from the higher level of investigation"
* move past being psychics into being an investigator: as a critic,
  move from guessing to asking
* once you know the objective of the visualization you're able to
  judge whether it succeeded or failed
* designers: provide retros. be accessible to critics


## Visual storytelling in the Age of Data, Robert Kosara

* academics don't get the idea of presenting data, communicating data. it's just an afterthought
* argues that stylizing charts is quite useful. helps to tell the
  story. emotional impact?
    * example: monstrous data by Nigel Holmes
* there's a danger to telling stories
    * can lead you down the wrong path

     example: driving an electric car in the parking lot until the battery
     runs down
     
* story telling potential of charts

<table class="comparison">
    <tr>
        <th>Story Depth</th>
        <th>Tells a Story</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Facts</td>
        <td>Narrative</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Information Scent</td>
        <td>Focus</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Audience</td>
        <td>Author</tr>
    </tr>
</table>


* storytelling affordances _(I love the idea of storytelling affordances)_
    * the form which lends itself to storytelling
    * what are they?
        * reading direction, left to right
        * in the famous napoleon chart, the area gets thinner
        * follow along a line, like following a journey on a map
          uses the driving safety in fits and starts article as example
        * animations
        * direction - the bush admin vs. obama admin us job loss bar chart
          effective way of walking you through developments
* narrative ties facts together
    * provides causality
    * walks you through a story
* facts - story depth
* focus - tells a story
    * kind of the natural enemy of more data
    * you must be selective in presenting data for it to be a story
* information scent - story depth
    * hints used to guide people, indicate that there's more data.
      example: the jobless rate for people like you
    * present a lot of information, but focus only on one bit.
      provide other data in a less visually prominent manner
* author - tells a story
* audience - story depth
* "we're at the cusp of something amazing and powerful that goes way
  beyond what's out there right now"


## comics and visual communication, scott mccloud

* in a 10" cube box of air is information
    * wifi, cell, radio
    * until there's something to decode that air, it really is just empty
* we both receive meaning and create it on the fly
    * the artist gives a hint of life, and the audience will meet them half way
* cartoonists
    * simplification creating a kind of human calligraphy
    * write with pictures
* human calligraphy takes many forms
    * body language
    * facial expressions
* there are six primary emotional expressions
    * anger
    * disgust
    * happiness
    * surprise
    * sadness
    * fear
    * the six primary combine
        * anger + happiness = cruelty
        * you can paint on the face the variety of emotions
* the grimace project
    * apparently useful for kids on the autism spectrum
* secret ingredient of the look of love is sadness
* all pictures are words
* all pictures speak
* all pictures have something to say
* something happens in lower grades - teach kids to write and to draw
    * at a certain point we teach kids words can be used for
        * lists
        * poems
        * express themselves
* but pictures - we try not to be too specific
* this overlooks the fact that pictures have a multiplicity of uses
    * can transmit messages, emotions
* as a result we have a society that divorces pictures from... specificity?
    * we have downstream pictures - advertising
    * don't have as much going upstream
* comics are a way to send messages upstream - can go out to a mass audience but retain their subjectivity
* will eisner believed comics can teach
    * the influencing machine
* tone is important
    * readiness.gov spawned great parodies
* now people are empowered to combine words and pictures anyway they want to
    * example: historical event facebook pages
* we need to be vigilant of cognitive load time
    * the speed at which individual parts load is the speed at which we can convey complex info
    * the rsanimate series, www.thersa.org
* synchronization of data/visuals with content
    * "i'm not going to even allow you to think about anything other than what I'm talking about right now"
    * order of presentation matters
    * "if I don't need to think it, I don't need to see it"
    * "the quicker the parts the richer the whole" cognitive load
* "form and content must never apologize for each other"
* the grammar of comics is putting one picture after another
    * creating a flow of time between images
    * as we move through space we move through time
    * any two images, we'll find a story, we'll find a narrative
    * cartoonists are finding the poetry in the gaps between frames
* as storytellers, you want your audience to lose themselves in the story
    * all narrative art forms are based on extremely simple principles
    * in comics: space = time
* "each successive technology would appropriate the previous technology as its content"
* grumpy old man rant about form factor
    * we see the world as rectangles in landscape mode
    * what possibilities open up when you consider the monitor to be a
      window?
    * lots of cool examples of comics taking advantage of the
      possibilities inherent in browsers  
* responsive web design
    * separating content from presentation
    * a noble impulse
    * but at the same time there are art forms which are fixed. comics is one of them
* the form matters!
    * in comics, the spatial relationship is part of the artistic intent
* when you have violent shifts in the landscape, the only thing you can do is hold on to basic principles
    * in comics, people losing themselves in the story

Many thanks to the hosts for putting together a great conference. I'm
looking forward to next year's!
