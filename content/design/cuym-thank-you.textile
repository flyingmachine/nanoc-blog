h1. Thank You

Thank you, everyone who has viewed <a href="http://www.visualmess.com">Clean Up Your Mess</a>. Thanks as well to everyone who has passed it on.

I made it because I want to help as many people as possible learn about and enjoy design, so it makes me happy to see that people are reading it and finding it worth telling other people about it.

Clean Up Your Mess has been the most difficult and time-consuming of all the side projects I've worked on. I was constantly questioning whether I was spending my time well and whether other people would find the guide useful. The past couple days have been very gratifying for me, and it feels like all the work was worth it.
