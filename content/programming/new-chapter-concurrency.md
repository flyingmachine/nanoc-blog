There's a new chapter up! It's on
["Concurrency, Parallelism, and State"](http://www.braveclojure.com/concurrency/).
And zommbies. And Lady Gaga. And dwarven berserkers. And mind reading :D

This has definitely been the most challenging chapter to write so far.
I've tried to explain the concepts in a way that's fun and easily
understandable for folks who haven't don't much, if any, parallel
programming. If anything's confusingly written I'd love to hear about
it :)ï»¿

By the way - if you're at ClojureWest, then lucky you! Sadly, I am
not, but I'd like to recommend Bridget Hillyer and Jennifer Eliuk's
talk on ClojureBridge. Bridget (and many others) have been doing a ton
of work to put on the first free Clojure workshop for women. If you
can't be there, send them some love on twitter, @bridgethillyer and
@7maples! Another recommendation: Alan Dipert and Micha Niskin's talk
on Hoplon. Alan is hilarious and brilliant, and Hoplon is really fun
to use. It's a very different and very enjoyable way to do frontend
programming.

Up next: some chapter revisions! After that, I'll write about Java
for Clojurists.
