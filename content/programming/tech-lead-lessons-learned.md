# Tech Lead Lessons Learned

Since September 2011 I've been the tech lead of a multi-cultural,
distributed team in an enterprise environment. I've definitely learned
a _lot_ during this time and thought I'd set it all down here.

## Communicate Honestly, Openly, and Compassionately

Trust is the bedrock of successful teams, and trust requires that
everyone on the team communicate honestly, openly, and
compassionately. This might even be more important on a distributed,
cross-cultural team where lack of face time and cultural differences
can cause misunderstandings.

This kind of communication can be hard. Speaking honestly about what's
really going on for you requires that you be vulnerable. Speaking
honestly about someone else's behavior requires that you take the risk
of damaging a relationship. What's more, most of us don't ever develop
these communication skills and feel like we don't know how to go about
it.

Below are some of my notes on what it meas to be honest, open, and
compassionate when you're talking with your teammates.

### Honest

Perhaps the best way to explain honesty is to contrast it with
"politics". You're engaging in office politics if you're hiding the truth
in order to control the way other people behave. You're being honest
when you faithfully relate your experiences and your observations.

If someone's behavior is upsetting you, it's essential that you talk
about the behavior _and_ the effect it's having on you. For example,
if one of your teammates has a habit of looking at his computer screen
while he's talking to you and that makes you feel like he's not acting
respectfully, it's important that you tell him that you feel
disrespected.

More often than not, these kinds of problems can be easily cleared up
and you might even laugh about them afterword. But if you don't say
anything then your underlying emotional issue will continue to fester,
and some other behavior will trigger it.

Because really, no one cares about behaviors in themselves. It's the
interpretations of behavior that ultimately matter. I might not even notice
the way a teammate's late half to half his meetings, whereas you might
see it as a lack of respect for your time and everyone else's. If that
underlying emotional discomfort is present, it _has_ to be addressed.

### Open

Being open means listening to what other people say without prejudice or
defensiveness. It also means acknowledging that you come with your own
set of biases, and that you don't have a perfect view of the universe.

Behaviorally, this amounts to listening to what your teammates are
saying with the understanding that your job is not to prove to him
that you've done nothing wrong. It means listening fully, without
interruption, and being confident enough in yourself to investigate
fully what your teammate's issue is.

It also means accepting that you do mess up, and that your teammate is
giving you a gift by pointing out your mistakes (hopefully in a
compassionate manner) because it shows that he trusts you enough to do
so and because you're being shown a way in which you can grow.

### Compassionate

Being compassionate means communicating with the understanding that
your words will affect another human being. I think it's popular to
believe that everyone is responsible for their own emotions and
therefore you should feel free to say whatever you want however you
want, but I don't think that's completely true. You have a
responsibility to communicate wisely.

This doesn't mean that you should let people off the hook. Nor does it
mean that you should sugar coat your communication. It just means that
you should do best to look after the welfare of your teammate.

## Clarify Roles and Responsibilities

This is just another way of saying that everyone should be clear about
what's expected of them and what they can expect of others. Without
this kind of clarity, it's easy for resentment to grow as teammates
feel like they're not being utilized properly or like unrealistic
requests are being made of them or like the people they're depending
on aren't coming through.

It's also important to re-evaluate expectations when the team changes.
It's easy to assume that things will continue as before (this is
something I've done), but that's not likely to be the case. At the
very least, have a discussion with incoming team members about their
understanding of their roles and responsibilities.

## Be Aware of Your Own Level fo Engagement

I struggled for a few weeks with a feeling that I didn't really know
what I was doing and that I wasn't being effective.

Once I was able to actually identify this feeling, I was able to talk
about it with some of my colleagues and over a couple of days I
redefined my role to something that I felt would allow me to
contribute more. After that, I was super happy with what I did.

## That's It for Now

So that's it for now. I'm sure I'll have more to write on this topic
in the future.
