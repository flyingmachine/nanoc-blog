In the Clojure community, one of the unwritten tenets is that
web frameworks can eat shit. Other languages might need frameworks, but
not ours! Libraries all the way, baby!

This attitude did not develop without reason. Many of us came to
Clojure after getting burned on magical monolith app frameworks like
Rails, where we ended up spending an inordinate amount of time coming
up with hacks for the framework's shortcomings. Another "problem" is
that tools like [Luminus](http://www.luminusweb.net/) and the top-rate
web dev libraries it bundles provide such a productive experience that
frameworks seem superfluous.

Be that as it may, I'm going to make the case for why the Clojurians'
view of frameworks needs revision. To explain why, I'll first share a
definition of what a framework actually is that I hope you'll find
both novel and intellectually satisfying. Then I'll explain the
benefits frameworks bring. Lastly, we'll engage in some
techno-futurism and dream up some ways that Clojure can be used to
create a completely kick-ass framework.
