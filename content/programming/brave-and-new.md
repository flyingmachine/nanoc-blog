summary: "The Clojure for the Brave and True web site has been updated to match the printed book. The book got a massive overhaul, and it's even better!"

*Clojure for the Brave and True* is now available in print! You can
use the coupon code ZOMBIEHUGS to get 30% off at
[No Starch](https://www.nostarch.com/clojure) (plus you'll get a free
[sticker](https://www.nostarch.com/images/Clojure_Sticker.jpg)), or
buy it from [Amazon](http://amzn.to/1Sojd8s).

The [web site](http://www.braveclojure.com/) has been updated, too!
(Don't forget to force refresh.) One of the reasons I went with No
Starch as a publisher was that they supported the idea of keeping the
entire book available for free online. It makes me super happy to
release the professionally-edited, even better book for free. I hope
it makes you laugh, cry, and give up on object-oriented programming
forever.

Writing this book was one of the most ambitious projects of my life,
and I appreciate all the support I've gotten from friends, family, and
readers like you. Thank you from the bottom of my crusty heart!

Is that it, then? Is the journey over? No! It's not! In fact, back in
April I quit my job in part so that I'd have more time for writing. I
have some new Clojure articles on reducers and transducers in the
works, plus I plan to write about web development again and dive into
fun libraries like `core.logic`, `clara`, and much more. There's just
so much cool stuff to learn about!  If you'd like me to let you know
when they're published then follow me on twitter

Lastly, to celebrate the book release, my wife (the book's
illustrator) put together a
[t-shirt and mug store](https://teechip.com/brave-and-true-release)!
The gear features the dwarf and warpig combo on the book cover :) This
run only lasts one week - future runs will feature other illustrations
from the book or from new projects. The money from that will help me
continue avoiding full-time employment so that I can keep creating
fun, high-quality Clojure content!

Thank you, and have fun Clojuring!

[Update] I got asked for a list of the major differences. Here they are:

* Illustrations!
* Almost every chapter now has exercises
* The first macro chapter, Read and Eval, is massively improved. I'm hoping this will gives readers an excellent conceptual foundation for working with macros
* There's now a joke about melting faces
* There used to be two Emacs chapters (basic emacs and using Emacs for Clojure dev), now there's just one
* The concurrency chapter got split into two chapters
* Appendices on Leiningen and Boot were added
* The "Do Things" chapter is much friendlier
* I spend a lot more time explaining some of the more obscure topics, like lazy sequences.
* Many of the chapters got massive overhauls. The functional programming chapter, for example, was turned completely inside out, and the result is that it's much, much clearer
* Overall, everything should be clearer
