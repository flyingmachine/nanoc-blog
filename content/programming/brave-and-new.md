*Clojure for the Brave and True* is now available in print! You can
use the coupon code ZOMBIEHUGS to get 30% off at
[No Starch](https://www.nostarch.com/clojure) (plus you'll get a free
[sticker](https://www.nostarch.com/images/Clojure_Sticker.jpg)), or
buy it from [Amazon](http://amzn.to/1jQXJ8a).

The [web site](http://www.braveclojure.com/) has been updated, too!
One of the reasons I went with No Starch as a publisher was that they
supported the idea of keeping the entire book available for free
online. It makes me super happy to release the professionally-edited,
even better book for free. I hope it makes you laugh, cry, and give up
on object-oriented programming forever.

Writing this book was one of the most ambitious projects of my life,
and I appreciate all the support I've gotten from friends, family, and
readers like you. Thank you from the bottom of my crusty heart!

Is that it, then? Is the journey over? No! It's not! In fact, back in
April I quit my job in part so that I'd have more time for writing. I
have some new Clojure articles on reducers and transducers in the
works, plus I plan to write about web development again and dive into
fun libraries like `core.logic`, `clara`, and much more. There's just
so much cool stuff to learn about!  If you'd like me to let you know
when they're published then follow me on twitter

Lastly, to celebrate the book release, my wife (the book's
illustrator) put together a
[t-shirt and mug store](https://teechip.com/brave-and-true-release)!
The gear features the dwarf and warpig combo on the book cover :) This
run only lasts one week - future runs will feature other illustrations
from the book or from new projects. The money from that will help me
continue avoid full-time employment so that I can continue creating
fun, high-quality Clojure content!

Thank you, and have fun Clojuring!
