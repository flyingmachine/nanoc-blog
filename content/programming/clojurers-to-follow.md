# Clojurers to Follow on Twitter

I follow all these Clojurers (Clojurians? Clojurists? Clojeoisie?)
because their tweets are interesting and useful. If you're into
Clojure, then I'm sure you'll want to follow them, too:

* [Bridget Hillyer @BridgetHiller](https://twitter.com/bridgethillyer)
  Bridget is one of the main forces behind
  [ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/), an organization
  which teaches free Clojure workshops to women. She's also one of the
  coolest people I know, and I'm proud to call her a friend!
* [Alan Dipert @alandipert](https://twitter.com/alandipert) Alan is
  the smartest person I know. He's also super funny and nice, which
  seems unfair to
  me. [Everything](http://adzerk.com/blog/2014/10/a-dashboard-with-hoplon/)
  he
  [writes](http://hoplon.discoursehosting.net/t/lets-talk-about-layout/223/5)
  will learn you good. I haven't discussed this with my wife yet, but
  I plan on naming my firstborn Dipert in his honor.
* [Eric Normand @ericnormand](https://twitter.com/ericnormand) Eric
  runs the [Clojure Gazette](http://www.clojuregazette.com/) and
  [LispCast](http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/). He's also a friendly
  guy who's passionate about teaching Clojure.
* [Carin Meier @gigasquid](https://twitter.com/gigasquid) Carin has
  written many
  [excellent articles](http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2014/03/20/world-domination-with-hexapods-and-clojure/)
  and given many [excellent talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty9QDqV-_Ak) on Clojure, specifically on using it
  to dominate the world with robots.
* [Bozhidar Botsav @bbatsov](https://twitter.com/bbatsov) Bozhidar is
  my Emacs hero! He maintains
  [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) and
  [writes about Emacs](http://emacsredux.com/). I don't understand how
  he manages to accomplish so much. My guess, though, is that he's
  written an AI clone of himself in elisp.
* [Fogus @fogus](https://twitter.com/fogus) Fogus goes by one name,
  which is completely badass. I really enjoy his tweets!
* [Alex Miller @puredanger](https://twitter.com/puredanger) Alex is
  the Clojure Community Czar. Follow him to hear about Clojure events
  and developments. Tweet him about all your stacktrace woes


That's it for now! If there's anyone you'd like me to add, please let
me know!  I'm [@nonrecursive](https://twitter.com/nonrecursive).
