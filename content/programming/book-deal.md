Good news everybody: I've signed a deal with
[No Starch Press](http://www.nostarch.com) to publish
[Clojure for the Brave and True](http://braveclojure.com)! Not only
that, the entire book will continue to be available for free online!

My hope is that this will provide as many people as possible with a
thorough, entertaining introduction to Clojure. No Starch provides the
best of both worlds. By being published through an established,
respected company, it's possible for *Clojure for the Brave and True*
to reach aspiring Clojurists through channels which I don't have the
time or means to cultivate. By keeping the book online for free, I
get to stay true to my hippie aspirations of free learning for
everyone. What's more, the book will now be professionally edited
&mdash; a big win for Clojure noobies and, I think, for the Clojure
community.

This is super cool! I can't think of any other publisher that allows
an author to continue publishing a book for free online as he writes.
I'm really excited by the book deal and am looking forward to
collaborating with No Starch. They really "get" that writing the book
is a creative, artistic endeavor for me. Also, writing Clojure is
*fun*, I want my book to be *fun*, and No Starch really understands
*fun*. Fun!

If you haven't already, please have a look at
[Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/). If you
have already &mdash; thank you! I've really appreciated all the
feedback and encouragement I've gotten so far, and I'm very happy to
be able to contribute back.
