After many months of editing existing chapters, I've written a
brand-new chapter,
["Interacting with Java"](http://www.braveclojure.com/java/).
Here's a snippet:

    There comes a day in every Clojurist's life when she must venture
    forth from the sanctuary of pure functions and immutable data
    structures into the wild and barbaric Land of Java. This
    treacherous journey is necessary because Clojure is hosted on the
    Java Virtual Machine (JVM), granting it three fundamental
    characteristics. First, you run Clojure applications the same way
    you run Java applications. Second, you need to use Java objects
    for core functionality like reading files and working with
    dates. Third, Java has a vast and wondrous ecosystem of incredible
    libraries, and Clojure makes it painless for you to use them. In
    this way, Clojure is a bit like a utopian community plunked down
    in the middle of a non-utopian country. It's preferable to
    interact with other utopians, but every once in a while you need
    to talk to the locals in order to get things done.

I appreciate all the tweets and emails I've received about the book;
it's very gratifying and it helps keep me motivated.

I'll be going to the [Clojure Conj](http://clojure-conj.org/) again
this year. This will be my third Conj, and I'm so excited for it. I
don't usually enjoy going to conferences, but I love the Conj because
the talks are absolutely incredible. I hope I see you there!
