Guess what! You can now [start reading the fully-revised Clojure for the Brave and True through No Starch Press’s early access program](http://nostarch.com/clojure)! Use the coupon code ZOMBIEHUGS for 30% off! You’ll get the first four chapters, complete with fun new illustrations and professional editing. The fifth chapter will be up soon, and the final release is scheduled for June 25th. It’s also a way to give feedback (which I will appreciate very much!) before it’s cast in adamantium for printing, or whatever it is you do to books to print them these days. If you’re enjoying the book, I’d love it if you shared this blog post or tweeted about the early access :)

I’m really happy with how the book has turned out. The No Starch editors have been awesome at helping to improve the clarity of the book, making it even more beginner-friendly. Most of the chapters have seen major rewrites, with significant improvements to the structure and content. I also appreciate all the comments, emails, and pull requests I’ve gotten. It warms the cockles of my heart to receive such generosity.

I think this book will be useful for Clojure beginners, and I’m especially happy that it will remain available for free online. (I’ll be updating the site with the new book once it’s published, i.e. when I actually have time again for the first time in 2 years :) I’m grateful for all the work the Clojure community has put into creating such a delightful language and useful ecosystem, and I’m glad to make my own little contribution. I hope you enjoy it!
