# Brave Clojure Jobs Re-write 

I’ve completely rewritten Brave Clojure Jobs to make it significantly easier for
companies to find great Clojure developers by making it dramatically easier to
post listings:

* **It’s now freemium.** You can post as many listings as you want without
  giving a credit card number. Charging per listing is nice for the job board's
  owner, but it doesn't make sense if you're trying to create a job board that
  serves the community as much as possible. The most useful job board would
  include every available opening, so I've tried to remove barriers to that
  goal. I'll describe the "mium" benefits farther down.
* **Import listings.** If you manage listings with Greenhouse, Workable, and
  similar services can (probably) just paste the listing's URL to import it.
  Eventually, I want to update the site to automatically sync a company's
  listings on Brave Clojure Jobs with their primary source of job listings.
  Listing import isn't perfect but it should save time.
* **Copy listings.** You can now create new listings from existing listings. The
  theme here is: make it super easy to create listings!
* **Copy/paste listings from a browser.** If you highlight and copy a listing in
  your browser and paste it in Brave Clojure Jobs, it will preserve the
  formatting, automatically converting it to markdown. I hope you'll find that
  this kind of attention to detail makes using Brave Clojure Jobs a great
  experience :D
* **First-class companies.** With the old version you could not manage your
  company's info separately from individual listings. Now you create a company
  profile, reducing repetition in your listings and creating a kind of company
  home page where devs can learn about you and see all your listings in one
  place.
* **Pre-filled company profiles.** I have been creating profiles for dozens of
  companies looking for Clojure developers. Be on the lookout for a link from me
  which will allow you to easily create a Brave Clojure Jobs user account
  associated with your company. I really want to make it easy for you to connect
  with a large audience of Clojure developers.

There are many more changes -- the UI is leagues better, there's better
integration with Stripe so you can manage payments without having to contact me,
etc. etc. etc. The main point is that I want the site help us all as much as a
job board possibly can. My hope is that this massive upgrade, which I've worked
on for more than a year, will be good for companies, good for devlopers, and
good for entire Clojure community.

Removing barriers to posting listings results in more listings. This makes Brave
Clojure Jobs more valuable to developers, growing the site's audience which in
turn makes it more valuable to companies. It's a virtuous cycle. (Side note: I'm
really patting myself on the back for using the term "virtuous cycle.")

Beyond companies and job seekers, however, I'm hoping these changes are helpful
for the Clojure community as a whole by providing a definitive answer to the
question, "Can I get hired to write Clojure?" I think this is a concern for
anyone considering learning the language; it's a large time investment and
people naturally want it to pay off. I want to show that the payoff is real.
More and more companies want to hire people to write Clojure because they know
doing so brings tangible benefits. This site will be the beautifully-designed
proof.

So a secondary goal of this rewrite is to create a kind of marketing resource
for the Clojure community: something we can point to to show that if you learn
the language you won't just become a better programmer, you'll also gain access
to expanded career opportunities. This will help grow the community, which in
turn will help ~~us take over the programming world~~ make the language an even
more viable choice for everybody.

A while back I began thinking that the best possible Clojure job board would... so I made it.



A while back I started thinking about what the best possible Clojure job board
would look like, and the main idea I kept coming back to is that it would
include every single Clojure job opening on the planet.

Such a job board would benefit everyone in the community: beyond making it
easier for companies and developers to find each other, it would also
definitively show people considering learning Clojure that, yes, there are a lot
of opportunties to get paid using the language.

To accomplish the goal of listing every open position, I've put a lot of work
into removing barriers to posting. Most significantly, I moved from a
pay-per-listing model to a freemium model: anyone can post an ad for free. Every
ad posted contributes to the network effect, benefiting everybody. Companies
will have the option to pay for support, automation, and higher visibility.

I'm very lucky to have gotten paid to write software with Clojure at great
companies with great coworkers for many years now. It's a wonderful language
with a friendly, helpful community, and I hope this site has a positive impact
on the Clojure world. I hope it helps people find jobs they love, and helps
companies find exceptional developers.
