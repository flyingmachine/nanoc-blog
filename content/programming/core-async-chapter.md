The first draft of
[Mastering Concurrent Processes with core.async](http://www.braveclojure.com/core-async/)
is now up on Clojure for the Brave and True. Here's a preview:

> One day, while you are walking down the street, you will be surprised,
> intrigued, and a little disgusted to discover a hot dog vending
> machine. Your scalp tingling with guilty curiosity, you won't be able
> to help yourself from pulling out three Sacagawea dollars and seeing
> if this contraption actually works. After accepting your money, it
> will emit a click and a whirr, and out will pop a fresh hot dog, bun
> and all.

Enjoy!
