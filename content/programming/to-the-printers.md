Today, my fantastic production editor at No Starch reached out and
pressed the basketball-sized "RELEASE IT!" button at No Starch
headquarters, encasing *Clojure for the Brave and True*
cucumber-infused amber and sending it on its way to the bookeries of
Melrose Park, Illinois.

At least, I'm *pretty* sure that's what happend. Either way, the book
is off to the printers! It's done! After two years of working on it,
it's actually done! Aaaaaah! It'll be available at the beginning of
September, and you can preorder it from
[No Starch](https://www.nostarch.com/clojure) (free ebook included
with print book) or
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Brave-True-Ultimate-Programmer/dp/1593275919/).

The main work (writing a book) is done, but there's actually still
more stuff to do. I need to finish rebuilding
[the website](http://www.braveclojure.com) to include all the updated
content and to make it easier to add more content. *What?!*, you ask,
*more content?!* Yes indeedy! The book may be finished, but there's
still so much more to write about! Expect a *Sidequests* series by the
end of the year.

Thanks for all the pull requests, emails, comments, and other
feedback. And I don't want to spoil the Acknowledgements section, but
I want to give my *Special Thanks* to Jess Higginbotham, Alan Dipert,
Bridget Hillyer, Joe Jackson, Pat Shaughnessy, Alex Rothenberg, Thomas
Newton, Jalil Fanaian, Chris Parker, Christian Lilley, and Mark
Daggett.

I hope you're having a great day. I am! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm
going to walk around the block pumping my fists in the air.
