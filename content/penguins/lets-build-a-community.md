# My Failed(?) Social Web Experiment Still Haunts Me

What will people post if they can't include links and can't use a handle?

This was the question I was looking to answer back in 2007 I launched
nobodynotes.com. It was a very simple web site, consisting mainly of a
text field and all the posts which people had entered in the text
field. You can
[see it, untyled](http://web.archive.org/web/20090402015728/http://nobodynotes.com/),
thanks to the wayback machine.

Initially, the posts were interesting to me, but probably unremarkable
to anyone else. Bits of poetry, parts of song, random curses. But then
something unexpected happened. More and more of the posts were written
in Persian.

Persian!? How did that happen? When I looked at Google Analytics, it
showed that the majority of my visits were from Iran, and that most of
my visitors were referred from Yahoo Mail. This was not something that
I had anticipated. It seemed like the site was going viral in Iran,
with people emailing it to each other specifically in Yahoo Mail.
Going through the site, I noticed that some of the posts referenced
others; each post had a number, and visitors would specify the number
of the post they were replying to. 

But why? Why all this activity from Iranians? I wanted to know, but
sadly had no direct way of finding out. After all, everyone was
anonymous. Not knowing what else, to do, I tried using Google
Translate to see what people were saying. One post in particular stood
out. It's probably irretrieval now, but a young man essentially wrote,
"Help, I am a gay man living in Iran. I cannot tell anyone, or I will
be killed. Please, someone help me."

To this day, that post haunts me. Who was this young man? Was he able
to find help? Where is he today, and is he OK?

I doubt I'll ever know the answer. I eventually shut down the site as
traffic slowed to a trickle. But pieces of it remain. It was connected
to a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/nobodynotes), where you can
still read fragments of those posts by anonymous Iranians. And there's
the wayback machine, which offers larger slices of conversation. And
there's Google Translate, offering me its demented assistance in
trying to understand what was happening a world away:

> Staring at the horizon, leaving the logo 
> side of life, rectified love 
> sitting in contemplation, madness, stood 
> an innocent face, a tired face 
> , relying on the fact, sad face smiling 
> at what an idea! 
> that madness pounding deep into each side. .
