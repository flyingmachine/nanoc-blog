Over the last couple months I've been working on a web site that helps
job seekers reduce stress by following a structured, methodical
process, and the site's ready for some beta testing. If you'd like to
help out, please
[sign up for the beta test](https://nonrecursive.wufoo.com/forms/job-search-site-beta/)!

This isn't a unicorn-disrupting once-a-generation app, just a simple
site to help people during a stressful process. For the beta test,
I'm just looking for feedback on what's broken, what's confusing, and
what could be useful but isn't implemented.

Thanks!


P.S. in case you're wondering, the site's all Clojure, with
compojure/liberator/datomic on the backend and reagent and re-frame on
the frontend.
