h1. About

This is the blog of Daniel Higginbotham, who will henceforth refer to himself in the first person.

I plan to write about design, programming, aikido, buddhism, communication, and a host of other topics which aren't usually seen rubbing elbows.

With design, I'll share my attempts at creating layouts and interfaces which are a joy to use. With programming, I'll share the code I've written, and hopefully it will help other folks. With aikido and buddhism, I'll probably just share my thoughts on what I've read and practiced. My obsession with communication will probably be evident in most things I write, and it is, after all, why I want to write anything in the first place.

So that's what this site is for. Not to sell or persuade, but just to share the things I love.
