          <h1>Buddy Systems at Work: a Framework for Rewarding Relationships on Remote Teams</h1>
          <div class='date'>04 June 2019</div>
          <p>One of my work mottos is "support the hell out of each other": helping
          your friends grow and succeed is far more rewarding than chasing after
          the next gold star for yourself. While I was at <a href="https://www.reifyhealth.com/">Reify
          Health</a> I was lucky enough to work with
          other devs who had a similar ethos. There were no rock stars, and
          everyone looked out for each other. I'm happy to have gotten to work
          somewhere where I made real, honest-to-god friends :)</p>
          
          <p>During my final weeks there I collaborated with coworkers on an
          experimental framework for supporting each other in a formal
          context. This framework would let us explore how to be there for each
          other in more meaningful ways while maintaining boundaries. This
          seemed particularly valuable in Reify's mostly-remote
          environment. With their permission, I'm sharing the initial framework
          proposal below:</p>
          
          <hr>
          
          <h2>The Buddy System</h2>
          
          <p>This doc outlines a proposal for a buddy system. The main idea behind the buddy system is for us to support each other by regularly spending time chatting with each other about things beyond whatever story is at hand. Exactly what that looks like will be up to you; this doc includes suggestions for how to have rewarding conversations. First, here are some ground rules:</p>
          
          <h2>Ground Rules</h2>
          
          <ol>
          <li>It‚Äôs confidential. Whatever you talk about remains between you and your buddy unless you say otherwise. This is meant to provide each other with time and space to speak about what‚Äôs going on :D</li>
          <li>It‚Äôs completely voluntary. You don‚Äôt have to participate, and if you do participate you can shape it however you want to: the frequency and content of chats is up to you.</li>
          <li>You can opt out or change buddies whenever you want. If you decide to drop out of the buddy system, it‚Äôs totally up to you if you want to explain why, or not. The buddy system is meant to consciously cultivate a space where we can be vulnerable with each other; part of making that safe is setting the expectation that people can opt out without having to explain why.</li>
          <li>By the same token, in joining the buddy system you accept that your buddy may at some point wish to opt or change buddies, and you commit to try to not take that personally if it happens üëç</li>
          <li>Every three months we‚Äôll change buddies - this gives us a chance to grow together, and also a chance to keep getting new perspectives by buddying with other folks on the team.</li>
          <li>There‚Äôs no impact on your yearly review. Though ‚ÄúBuddy System‚Äù would be a wonderfully Orwellian name for a mandatory chatting initiative.</li>
          <li>It‚Äôs reciprocal. Buddies commit to listening to and sharing with each other. If you feel like you have room to grow with listening or sharing, that‚Äôs totally cool - and a good first step is to share that with your buddy :)</li>
          <li>It‚Äôs not hierarchical. Being a Buddy means whole-hearted listening, asking questions, and just being supportive, which is independent of any junior or senior designations.</li>
          <li>The point is to support each other as human beings, not to meet project objectives :-)</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h2>Suggestions</h2>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Tell your buddy what you want to get out of the buddy system. Do you want to talk about your career? Your goals at Reify? How to improve our architecture? By letting your buddy know what you‚Äôre looking for, you can get all Jerry Maguire and help them help you.</li>
          <li>Listen your asses off. Avoid the urge to give advice unless asked for it, but instead try to truly understand what your buddy is saying, and try to help them gain clarity.</li>
          <li>Potential topics include goal-setting and ‚Äúlife at Reify.‚Äù
          
          <ul>
          <li>Goal setting: It can be very useful to talk to someone about your broader goals and to have them hold you accountable. Sharing a goal often makes it more meaningful and gives you more motivation to reach it.</li>
          <li>Life at Reify: We have retros, which are useful, but regular one-on-one conversations also have a place in supporting each other</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>These topic suggestions are not meant to be exhaustive.</li>
          <li>When asking for feedback, communicate what kind of feedback you want:
          
          <ul>
          <li>A pat on the back</li>
          <li>High-level feedback</li>
          <li>Nitty-gritty feedback</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Notes</h2>
          
          <p>Daniel is acting as facilitator in that he‚Äôs organizing discussion about the Buddy System so that we all come to a shared understanding of what it is and what we want to get out of it. However, Daniel isn‚Äôt, like, the Buddy System‚Äôs owner, and can‚Äôt tell you what to do.</p>
          
          <hr>
          
          <p>Some reading this might be uncomfortable with the ideas outlined in
          the buddy system - and that's totally ok! A key part of the framework
          is <em>you don't have to buy into it</em>. But I think it speaks volumes
          about the level of trust and mutual good feeling among the team that
          almost everyone was excited about it while respecting that we're all
          different and not everyone prefers the same way of interacting. On the
          other hand, new hires were especially excited because they felt like
          it would help them acclimate to their new environment. To me, a team
          that is enthusiastic about these ideas is a team that I'd want to work
          with; it's a team that actually likes the idea of relating to each
          other on a real, human level.</p>
          
          <p>One topic that came up was, how is this different from just being
          friends? Is it really necessary to have a <em>structure</em> that everyone
          agrees to? Does that bring an element of artifice into friendship? My
          thinking is that structure is a precondition for
          vulnerability. Structure tells us to be extra mindful in how we
          interact with each other, and it provides boundaries (like a clear
          time limit) to protect us from getting overwhelmed. By designating a
          time and place to consciously interact with each other, it also
          resolves the problem of never knowing when is "the right time" to
          bring something up.</p>
          
          <p>This would be helpful for new hires, sure, but even in my personal
          life I've found that structure is much better at fostering deeper
          interactions than just winging it. Knowing that everyone is "in it"
          together <em>and</em> that "it" won't last forever provides a solid
          foundation for trust.</p>
          
          <p>Final note: vulnerability here does <em>not</em> mean you have to spill your
          guts, emotionally leaking on each other all the time. It <em>does</em> mean
          feeling safe to express that you're struggling or that you feel
          dissatisfied or hurt in some way.</p>
          
          <p>What are your thoughts? Have you tried something like this where you
          worked, and how did it go?</p>
