          <h1>Announcing Job Search Sanity</h1>
          <div class='date'>09 December 2015</div>
          <p>One of the least fun experiences in my life was getting fired twice in
          three months back in 2008 when the economy decided to go all <em>YOLO</em>
          and drive off a cliff with its middle finger waving out the
          window. The first time, I was a wreck. I was in a relationship with
          someone who had a chronic medical condition and the attendant medical
          bills. As the sole money earner, I was pretty bummed! Every day I felt
          dread and panic as I pored over job listings. I made many
          stress-induced mistakes like emailing the same contact twice or
          forgetting phone interviews.</p>
          
          <p>But somehow I found a job at a startup pretty quickly, only to be
          regrettably let go a couple months later because they were running out
          of money. This time, I did things differently. I took a <em>Getting
          Things Done</em> inspired approach to the job search. Approaching the 
          search in an organized, methodical way made me feel in control. It
          also gave me confidence that I was making real progress on finding a
          job because I could actually see all the steps I was taking. At the
          end of the day I knew I had done what I could to move forward.</p>
          
          <p>Today I'm releasing a free web application,
          <a href="https://jobsearchsanity.com">Job Search Sanity</a>, to help others do
          the same. It helps you keep track of each job opportunity and the next
          actions you need to do to move forward. It also keeps cover letters
          and interview remindres in place. And one of its best features is that
          it lets you save your job searches on the site so you can keep them
          all in one place instead of visiting dozens of sites every day.</p>
          
          <p>If you're looking for a job and feel overwhelmed, then
          please give it a try! If you know someone who's looking for a job,
          please send them a link!</p>
          
          <h2>Personal Notes</h2>
          
          <p>The main thing that motivated me to create this site was seeing my
          brother struggle with finding employment after graduating with a
          Pharm.D. (doctor of pharmacy) degree last year. After spending a
          decade putting himself through school, he had the modest expectation
          of finding decent-paying, stable work. Instead, he found that the
          pharmacy market had radically changed while he was getting his degree,
          and jobs were scarce.</p>
          
          <p>I can only imagine how crushing it would feel to commit so much of
          your life (and accumulating large student loan debts) to learning
          profession, only to find that the rules had changed and there was
          actually little demand for your skills. To find that the future you've
          been working toward for so long has vanished, replaced with utter
          uncertainty.</p>
          
          <p>It was a rough time for him, but thankfully he did eventually find a
          job as a pharmacist. While he was looking, he came to live with me,
          and I was so glad that I was able to help in some way (and that I got
          to spend so much time with him), but part of me wished I could have
          done more.</p>
          
          <p>Cut to the present day, where my wife has been looking for a better
          job for a while, and I can see the stress affecting her in similar
          ways (though to a much lesser degree, thankfully).</p>
          
          <p>All of which is to say - I know that looking for a job can be
          incredibly stressful, and I hope that by providing this free app I can
          help people in similar situations. I kind of need to make something
          that I actually accept payments for soon, but for this site I didn't
          want their to be any barriers to signing up and using it. Perhaps I'll
          figure out way to monetize it, but for now I'm proud of the site and
          I'll count it a success if it helps even a dozen people as they find a
          job.</p>
          
          <h2>Development Notes</h2>
          
          <p>Job Search Sanity was built using:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>The <a href="http://boot-clj.com/">Boot</a> build tool. Boot made it easy to
          integrate a Clojure backend, ClojureScript frontend, and Sass
          compilation</li>
          <li>
          <a href="http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/">Liberator</a>, to
          structure the handling of back-end API calls</li>
          <li>
          <a href="/programming/datomic-for-five-year-olds/">Datomic</a> for the database</li>
          <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/Day8/re-frame">re-frame</a> as the lightweight
          front-end structure imposed on
          <a href="https://reagent-project.github.io/">reagent</a>
          </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>I absolutely <em>loved</em> working on the site because the tools made it so
          much <em>fun</em>. One of my personal goals was to stretch myself design- and
          UX-wise, and the above programming tools made that possible by making
          it so simple and easy to implement the basic functionality.</p>
          
          <p>ClojureScript has come incredibly far in the past couple years. A year
          or two ago I looked at it but stuck with Coffeescript because cljs
          looked like a pain in the ass to use, but that isn't the case any
          longer. The only downside here is that, once again, Clojure has
          spoiled me, and I never want to go back to my previous tools.</p>
