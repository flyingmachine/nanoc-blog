          <h1>Frameworks and Why (Clojure) Programmers Need Them</h1>
          <div class='date'>13 August 2019</div>
          <p>It seems like there's a strong aversion to using frameworks in the
          Clojure community. Other languages might need frameworks, but not
          ours! Libraries all the way, baby!</p>
          
          <p>This attitude did not develop without reason. Many of us came to
          Clojure after getting burned on magical frameworks like Rails, where
          we ended up spending an inordinate amount of time coming up with hacks
          for the framework's shortcomings. Another "problem" is that Clojure
          tools like <a href="http://www.luminusweb.net/">Luminus</a> and the top-rate web
          dev libraries it bundles provide such a productive experience that
          frameworks seem superfluous.</p>
          
          <p>Be that as it may, I'm going to make the case for why the community's
          dominant view of frameworks needs revision. Frameworks are useful. To
          convince you, I'll start by explaining what a framework is. I have yet
          to read a definition of <em>framework</em> that satisfies me, and I think
          some of the hate directed at them stems from a lack of clarity about
          what exactly they are. Are they just glorified libraries? Do they have
          to be magical?  Is there some law decreeing that they have to be more
          trouble than they're worth? All this and more shall be revealed.</p>
          
          <p>I think the utility of frameworks will become evident by describing
          the purpose they serve and how they achieve that purpose. The
          description will also clarify what makes a <em>good</em> framework and
          explain why some frameworks end up hurting us. My hope is that you'll
          find this discussion interesting and satisfying, and that it will give
          you a new, useful perspective not just on frameworks but on
          programming in general. Even if you still don't want to use a
          framework after you finish reading, I hope you'll have a better
          understanding of the problems frameworks are meant to solve and that
          this will help you design applications better.</p>
          
          <p>Frameworks have second-order benefits, and I'll cover those too. They
          make it possible for an ecosystem of reusable components to
          exist. They make programming fun. They make it easier for beginners to
          make stuff.</p>
          
          <p>Last, I'll cover some ways that I think Clojure is uniquely suited to
          creating kick-ass frameworks.</p>
          
          <p>(By the way: I've written this post because I'm building a Clojure
          framework! So yeah this is totally my Jedi mind trick to prime you to
          use <em>my</em> framework. The framework's not released yet, but I've used it
          to build <a href="https://gratefulplace.com">Grateful Place, a community for people who are into
          cultivating gratitude, compassion, generosity, and other positive
          practices</a>. Just as learning Clojure makes
          you a better programmer, learning to approach each day with
          compassion, curiosity, kindness, and gratitude will make you a more
          joyful person. If you want to brighten your day and mine, please
          join!)</p>
          
          <h2>What is a Framework?</h2>
          
          <p>A framework is a set of libraries that:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Manages the complexity of coordinating the <em>resources</em> needed to
          write an application...</li>
          <li>by providing <em>abstractions</em> for those resources...</li>
          <li>and <em>systems for communicating</em> between those resources...</li>
          <li>within an <em>environment</em>...</li>
          <li>so that programmers can <em>focus on writing the business logic</em> that's
          specific to their product</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>I'll elaborate on each of these points using examples from
          <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and from the ultimate framework: the
          <em>operating system</em>. </p>
          
          <p>You might wonder, how is an OS a framework? When you look at the list
          of framework responsibilities, you'll notice that the OS handles all
          of them, and it handles them exceedingly well. Briefly: an OS provides
          virtual abstractions for hardware resources so that programmers don't
          have to focus on the details of, say, pushing bytes onto some
          particular disk or managing CPU scheduling. It also provides the
          conventions of a hierarchical filesystem with an addressing system
          consisting of names separated by forward slashes, and these
          conventions provide one way for resources to communicate with each
          other (Process A can write to <code>/foo/bar</code> while Process B reads from
          it) - if every programmer came up with her own bespoke addressing
          system, it would be a disaster. The OS handles this for us so we can
          focus on application-specific tasks.</p>
          
          <p>Because operating systems are such successful frameworks we'll look at
          a few of their features in some detail so that we can get a better
          understanding of what good framework design looks like.</p>
          
          <h3>Coordinating Resources</h3>
          
          <p><em>Resources</em> are the "materials" used by programs to do their work, and
          can be divided into four categories: storage, computation,
          communication, and interfaces. Examples of storage include files,
          databases, and caches. Computation examples include processes,
          threads, actors, background jobs, and core.async processes. For
          communication there are HTTP requests, message queues, and event
          buses. Interfaces typically include keyboard and mouse, plus screens
          and the systems used to display stuff on them: gui toolkits, browsers
          and the DOM, etc.</p>
          
          <p>Specialized resources are built on top of more general-purpose
          resources. (Some refer to these specialized resources as <em>services</em> or
          <em>components</em>.) We start with hardware and build virtual resources on
          top. With storage, the OS starts with disks and memory and creates the
          filesystem as a virtual storage resource on top. Databases like
          Postgres use the filesystem to create another virtual storage resource
          to handle use cases not met by the filesystem. Datomic uses other
          databases like Cassandra or DynamoDB as its storage layer. Browsers
          create their own virtual environments and introduce new resources like
          local storage and cookies.</p>
          
          <p>For computation, the OS introduces processes and threads as virtual
          resources representing and organizing program execution. Erlang
          creates an environment with a process model that's dramatically
          different from the underlying OS's. Same deal with Clojure's
          <code>core.async</code>, which introduces the <em>communicating sequential
          processes</em> computation model. It's a virtual model defined by Clojure
          macros, "compiled" to core clojure, then compiled to JVM bytecode (or
          JavaScript!), which then has to be executed by operating system
          processes.</p>
          
          <p>Interfaces follow the same pattern: on the visual display side, the OS
          paints to monitors, applications paint to their own virtual canvas,
          browsers are applications which introduce their own resources (the DOM
          and <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>), and React introduces a virtual DOM. Emacs is an
          operating system on top of the operating system, and it provides
          windows and frames.</p>
          
          <p>Resources manage their own <em>entities</em>: in a database, entities could
          include tables, rows, triggers, and sequences. Filesystem entities
          include directories and files. A GUI manages windows, menu bars, and
          other components.</p>
          
          <p>(I realize that this description of <em>resource</em> is not the kind of
          airtight, axiomatic, comprehensive description that programmers like.
          One shortcoming is that the boundary between resource and application
          is pretty thin: Postgres is an application in its own right, but from
          the perspective of a Rails app it's a resource. Still, hopefully my
          use of <em>resource</em> is clear enough that you nevertheless understand
          what the f I'm talking about when I talk about resources.)</p>
          
          <p>Coordinating these resources is inherently complex. Hell, coordinating
          anything is complex. I still remember the first time I got smacked in
          the face with a baseball in little league thanks to a lack of
          coordination. There was also a time period where I, as a child, took
          tae kwon do classes and frequently ended up sitting with my back
          against the wall with my eyes closed in pain because a) my mom for
          some reason refused to buy me an athletic cup and b) I did not possess
          the coordination to otherwise protect myself during sparring.</p>
          
          <p>When building a product, you have to decide how to create, validate,
          secure, and dispose of resource entities; how to convey entities from
          one resource to another; and how to deal with issues like timing (race
          conditions) and failure handling that arise whenever resources
          interact, all without getting hit in the face. Rails, for instance,
          was designed to coordinate browsers, HTTP servers, and databases. It
          had to convey user input to a database, and also retrieve and render
          database records for display by the user interface, via HTTP requests
          and responses.</p>
          
          <p>There is no obvious or objectively correct way to coordinate these
          resources. In Rails, HTTP requests would get dispatched to a
          Controller, which was responsible for interacting with a database and
          making data available to a View, which would render HTML that could be
          sent back to the browser.</p>
          
          <p>You don't <em>have</em> to coordinate web app resources using the
          Model/View/Controller (MVC) approach Rails uses, but you do have to
          coordinate these resources <em>somehow</em>. These decisions involve making
          tradeoffs and imposing constraints to achieve a balance of
          extensibility (creating a system generic enough for new resources to
          participate) and power (allowing the system to fully exploit the
          unique features of a specific resource).</p>
          
          <p>This is a very difficult task even for experienced developers, and the
          choices you make could have negative repercussions that aren't
          apparent until you're heavily invested in them. With Rails, for
          instance, ActiveRecord (AR) provided a good generic abstraction for
          databases, but early on it was very easy to produce extremely
          inefficient SQL, and sometimes very difficult to produce efficient
          SQL. You'd often have to hand-write SQL, eliminating some of the
          benefits of using AR in the first place.</p>
          
          <p>For complete beginners, the task of making these tradeoffs is
          impossible because doing so requires experience. Beginners won't even
          know that it's necessary to make these decisions. At the same time,
          more experienced developers would prefer to spend their time and
          energy solving more important problems.</p>
          
          <p>Frameworks make these decisions for us, allowing us to focus on
          business logic, and they do so by introducing <em>communication systems</em>
          and <em>abstractions</em>.</p>
          
          <h3>Resource Abstractions</h3>
          
          <p>Our software interacts with resources via their <em>abstractions</em>. I
          think of abstractions as:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>the data structures used to represent a resource</li>
          <li>the set of messages that a resource responds to</li>
          <li>the mechanisms the resource uses to call your application's code</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>(<em>Abstraction</em> might be a terrible word to use here. Every developer
          over three years old has their own definition, and if mine doesn't
          correspond to yours just cut me a little slack and run with it :)</p>
          
          <p>Rails exposes a database resource that your application code interacts
          with via the <code>ActiveRecord</code> abstraction. Tables correspond to classes,
          and rows to objects of that class. This a choice with tradeoffs - rows
          could have been represented as Ruby hashes (a primitive akin to a JSON
          object), which might have made them more portable while making it more
          difficult to concisely express database operations like <code>save</code> and
          <code>destroy</code>. The abstraction also responds to <code>find</code>, <code>create</code>,
          <code>update</code>, and <code>destroy</code>. It calls your application's code via
          lifecycle callback methods like <code>before_validation</code>. Frameworks add
          value by identifying these lifecycles and providing interfaces for
          them when they're absent from the underlying resource.</p>
          
          <p>You already know this, but it bears saying: abstractions let us code
          at a higher level. Framework abstractions handle the concerns that are
          specific to resource management, letting us focus on building
          products. Designed well, they enable loose coupling.</p>
          
          <p>Nothing exemplifies this better than the massively successful <em>file</em>
          abstraction that the UNIX framework introduced. We're going to look at
          in detail because it embodies design wisdom that can help us
          understand what makes a good framework.</p>
          
          <p>The core file functions are <code>open</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and
          <code>close</code>. Files are represented as sequential streams of bytes, which
          is just as much a choice as ActiveRecord's choice to use Ruby
          objects. Within processes, open files are represented as <em>file
          descriptors</em>, which are usually a small integer. The <code>open</code> function
          takes a path and returns a file descriptor, and <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and
          <code>close</code> take a file descriptor as an argument to do their work.</p>
          
          <p>Now here's the amazing magical kicker: <em>file</em> doesn't have to mean
          <em>file on disk</em>. Just as Rails implements the ActiveRecord abstraction
          for MySQL and Postgres, the OS implements the file abstraction for
          <strong>pipes</strong>, terminals, and other resources, meaning that your programs
          can write to them using the same system calls as you'd use to write
          files to disk - indeed, from your program's standpoint, all it knows
          is that it's writing to a file; it doesn't know that the "file" that a
          file descriptor refers to might actually be a pipe.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>Exercise for the reader: write a couple paragraphs explaining
          precisely the design choices that enable this degree of loose
          coupling. How can these choices help us in evaluating and designing
          frameworks?</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This design is a huge part of UNIX's famed simplicity. It's what lets
          us run this in a shell:</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># list files in the current directory and perform a word count on the output</span>&#x000A;ls <span class="p">|</span> wc</pre></div>
          <p>The shell interprets this by launching an <code>ls</code> process. Normally, when
          a process is launched it creates three file descriptors (which,
          remember, represent open files): <code>0</code> for <code>STDIN</code>, <code>1</code> for <code>STDOUT</code>,
          and <code>2</code> for <code>STDERR</code>, and the shell sets each file descriptor to refer
          to your terminal (terminals can be files!! what!?!?). Your shell sees
          the pipe, <code>|</code>, and sets <code>ls</code>'s <code>STDOUT</code> to the pipe's <code>STDIN</code>, and the
          pipe's <code>STDOUT</code> to <code>wc</code>'s <code>STDIN</code>. The pipe links processes' file
          descriptors, while the processes get to read and write "files" without
          having to know what's actually on the other end. No joke, every time I
          think of this I get a little excited tingle at the base of my
          spine because I am a:</p>
          
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRsPheErBj8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          
          <p>This is why file I/O is referred to as <em>the universal I/O model</em>. I'll
          have more to say about this in the next section, but I share it here
          to illustrate how much more powerful your programming environment can
          be if you find the right abstractions. The file I/O model still
          dominates decades after its introduction, making our lives easier
          <em>without our even having to understand how it actually works</em>.</p>
          
          <p>The canonical first exercise any beginner programmer performs is to
          write a program that prints out, <em>Wassup, homies?</em>. This program makes
          use of the file model, but the beginner doesn't have to even know that
          such a thing exists. This is what a good framework does. A
          well-designed framework lets you easily get started building simple
          applications, without preventing you building more complicated and
          useful ones as you learn more.</p>
          
          <p>One final point about abstractions: they provide mechanisms for
          calling your application's code. We saw this a bit earlier with
          ActiveRecord's lifecycle methods. Frameworks will usually provide the
          overall structure for how an application should interact with its
          environment, defining sets of events that you write custom handlers
          for. With ActiveRecord lifecycles, the structure of <code>before_create</code>,
          <code>create</code>, <code>after_create</code> is predetermined, but you can define what
          happens at each step. This pattern is called <em>inversion of control</em>,
          and many developers consider it a key feature of frameworks.</p>
          
          <p>With *nix operating systems, you could say that in C programs the
          <code>main</code> function is a kind of <code>onStart</code> callback. The OS calls <code>main</code>,
          and <code>main</code> tells the OS what instructions should be run. However, the
          OS controls when instructions are actually executed because the OS is
          in charge of scheduling. It's a kind of inversion of control, right? 🤔</p>
          
          <h3>Communication</h3>
          
          <p>Frameworks coordinate resources, and (it's almost a tautology to say
          this) coordination requires <em>communication</em>. Communication is
          <em>hard</em>. Frameworks make it easier by translating the disparate
          "languages" spoken by resources into one or more common languages that
          are easy to understand and efficient, while also ensuring
          extensibility and composability. Frameworks also do some of the work
          of ensuring resilience. This usually entails:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Establishing naming and addressing conventions</li>
          <li>Establishing conventions for how to structure content</li>

          <li>Handling communication failures (the database is down! that file
          doesn't exist!)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>One example many people are familiar with is the HTTP stack, a
          "language" used to communicate between browser and server resources:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>HTTP structures content (request headers and request body as text)</li>
          <li>TCP handles communication failures</li>
          <li>IP handles addressing</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Conventions</h4>
          
          <p>The file model is a "common language", and the OS uses device drivers
          to translate between between the file model and whatever local
          language is spoken by hardware devices. It has naming and addressing
          conventions, letting you specify files on the filesystem using
          character strings separated by slashes that it translates to an
          internal inode (a data structure that stores file and directory
          details, like ownership and permissions). We're so used to this that
          it's easy to forget it's a convention; *nix systems could have been
          designed so that you had to refer to files using a number or a
          UUID. The file descriptors I described in the last section are also a
          convention.</p>
          
          <p>Another convention the file model introduces is to structure content
          as byte streams, as opposed to bit streams, character streams, or xml
          documents. However, bytes are usually too low-level, so the OS
          includes a suite of command line tools that introduce the further
          convention of structuring bytes by interpreting them as characters
          (<code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>grep</code>, and friends). More recently, more tools have
          been introduced that interpret text as YAML or JSON. The Clojure world
          has further tools to interpret JSON as transit. My YAML tools can't do
          jack with your JSON files, but because these formats are all expressed
          in terms of lower-level formats, the lower-level tools can still work
          with them. Structure affects composability.</p>
          
          <p>The file model's simplicity is what allows it to be the "universal I/O
          model." I mean, just imagine if all Linux processes had to communicate
          with XML instead of byte streams! Hoo boy, what a crazy world that
          would be. Having a simple, universal communication system makes it
          extremely easy for new resources to participate without having to be
          directly aware of each other. It allows us to easily compose command
          line tools. It allows one program to write to a log while another
          reads from it. In other words, it enables loose coupling and all the
          attendant benefits.</p>
          
          <h4>Communication Brokers</h4>
          
          <p><em>Globally addressable communication brokers</em> (like the filesystem, or
          Kafka queues, or databases) are essential to enabling composable
          systems. <em>Global</em> means that every resource can access
          it. <em>Addressable</em> means that the broker maintains identifiers for
          entities independently of its clients, and it's possible for clients
          to specify entities using those identifiers. <em>Communication broker</em>
          means that the system's purpose is to convey data from one resource to
          another, and it has well-defined semantics: a queue has FIFO
          semantics, the file system has update-in-place semantics, etc.</p>
          
          <p>If Linux had no filesystem and processes were only allowed to
          communicate via pipes, it would be a nightmare. Indirect communication
          is more flexible than direct communication. It supports decoupling
          over time, in that reads and writes don't have to happen
          synchronously. It also allows participants to drop in and out of the
          communication system independently of each other. (By the way, I can't
          think of the name for this concept or some better way to express it,
          and would love feedback here.)</p>
          
          <p>I think this is the trickiest part of framework design. At the
          beginning of the article I mentioned that developers might end up
          hacking around a framework's constraints, and I think the main
          constraint is often the absence of a communication broker. The
          framework's designers introduce new resources and abstractions, but
          the only way to compose them is through direct communication, and
          sometimes that direct communication is handled magically. (I seem to
          recall that Rails worked with this way, with tight coupling between
          Controller and Views and a lack of options for conveying Controller
          data to other parts of the system). If someone wants to introduce new
          abstractions, they have to untangle all the magic and hook deep into
          the framework's internals, using -- or even patching! -- code that's
          meant to be private.</p>
          
          <p>I remember running into this with Rails back when MongoDB was
          released; the <em>document database</em> resource was sufficiently different
          from the <em>relational database resource</em> that it was pretty much
          impossible for MongoDB to take part in the ActiveRecord abstraction,
          and it was also very difficult to introduce a new data store
          abstraction that would play well with the rest of the Rails ecosystem.</p>
          
          <p>For a more current example, a frontend framework might identify the
          form as a resource, and create a nice abstraction for it that handles
          things like validation and the submission lifecycle. If the form
          abstraction is written in a framework that has no communication broker
          (like a global state container), then it will be very difficult to
          meet the common use case of using a form to filter rows in a table
          because there's no way for the code that renders table data to access
          the form inputs' values. You might come up with some hack like
          defining handlers for exporting the form's state, but doing this on an
          ad-hoc basis results in confusing and brittle code.</p>
          
          <p>By contrast, the presence of a communication broker can make life much
          easier. In the Clojure world, the React frameworks
          <a href="https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/">re-frame</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om">om.next</a> have embraced global state
          atoms, a kind of communication broker similar to the filesystem (atoms
          are an in-memory storage mechanism). They also both have well defined
          communication protocols. I'm not very familiar with
          <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> but I've heard tell that it also has
          embraced a global, central state container.</p>
          
          <p>If you create a form abstraction using re-frame, it's possible to
          track its state in a global state atom. It's further possible to
          establish a naming convention for forms, making it easier for other
          participants to look up the form's data and react to it. (Spoiler
          alert: the framework I've been working on does this!)</p>
          
          <p>Communication systems are fundamental. Without them, it's difficult to
          build anything but the simplest applications. By providing
          communication systems, frameworks relieve much of the cognitive burden
          of building a program. By establishing communication standards,
          frameworks make it possible for developers to create composable tools,
          tools that benefit everybody who uses that framework. Standards make
          infrastructure possible, and infrastructure enables productivity.</p>
          
          <p>In this section I focused primarily on the file model because it's
          been so successful and I think we can learn a lot from it. Other
          models include event buses and message queues. I'm not going to write
          about these because I'm not made of words, ok?!?</p>
          
          <h3>Environments</h3>
          
          <p>Frameworks are built to coordinate resources within a particular
          <em>environment</em>. When we talk about desktop apps, web apps, single page
          apps, and mobile apps, we're talking about different
          environments. From the developer's perspective, environments are
          distinguished by the resources that are available, while from the
          user's perspective different environments entail different usage
          patterns and expectations about distribution, availability, licensing,
          and payment.</p>
          
          <p>As technology advances, new resources become available (the Internet!
          databases! smart phones! powerful browsers! AWS!), new environments
          evolve to combine those resources, and frameworks are created to
          target those environments. This is why we talk about mobile frameworks
          and desktop frameworks and the like.</p>
          
          <p>One of the reasons I stopped using Rails was because it was a <em>web
          application framework</em>, but I wanted to build <em>single page
          applications</em>. At the time (around 2012?), I was learning to use
          Angular and wanted to deploy applications that used it, but it didn't
          really fit with Rails's design.</p>
          
          <p>And that's OK. Some people write programs for Linux, some people write
          for macOS, some people still write for Windows for some reason (just
          kidding! don't kill me!). A framework is a tool, and tools are built
          for a specific purpose. If you're trying to achieve a purpose the tool
          isn't built for, use a different tool.</p>
          
          <h2>More Benefits of Using Frameworks</h2>
          
          <p>So far I've mostly discussed how frameworks bring benefits to the
          individual developer. In this section I'll explain how frameworks
          benefit communities, how they make programming fun, and (perhaps most
          importantly) how they are a great boon for beginners.</p>
          
          <p>First, to recap, a framework is a set of libraries that:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Manages the complexity of coordinating the <em>resources</em> needed to
          write an application</li>
          <li>By providing <em>abstractions</em> for those resources</li>
          <li>And <em>systems for communicating</em> between those resources</li>
          <li>Within an <em>environment</em>
          </li>
          <li>So that programmers can focus on writing the business logic that's
          specific to their product</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>This alone lifts a huge burden off of developers. In case I haven't
          said it enough, this kind of work is <em>hard</em>, and if you had to do it
          every time you wanted to make an application it would be frustrating
          an exhausting. Actually, let me rephrase that: I <em>have</em> had to do this
          work, and it <em>is</em> frustrating and exhausting. It's why Rails was such
          a godsend when I first encountered it in 2005.</p>
          
          <h3>Frameworks Bring Community Benefits</h3>
          
          <p>Clear abstractions and communication systems allow people to share
          modules, plugins, or whatever you want to call framework extensions,
          creating a vibrant ecosystem of reusable components.</p>
          
          <p>If you accept my assertion that an operating system is a framework,
          then you can consider any program which communicates via one of the
          OS's communication systems (sockets, the file model, etc) to be an
          extension of the framework. Postgres is a framework extension that adds
          an RDBMS resource. statsd is an extension that adds a monitoring
          resource.</p>
          
          <p>Similarly, Rails makes it possible for developers to identify
          specialized resources and extend the framework to easily support
          them. One of the most popular and powerful is
          <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a>, which coordinates
          Rails resources to introduce a new user authentication resource. Just
          as using Postgres is usually preferable to rolling your own database,
          using Devise is usually preferable to rolling your own authentication
          system.</p>
          
          <p>Would it be possible to create a Devise for Clojure? I don't think
          so. Devise is designed to be database agnostic, but because Clojure
          doesn't really have a go-to framework that anoints or introduces a
          go-to database abstraction, no one can write the equivalent of Devise
          in such a way that it could easily target any RDBMS. Without a
          framework, it's unlikely that someone will be able to write a
          full-featured authentication solution that you can reuse, and if you
          write one it's unlikely others would see much benefit if you shared
          it. I think it's too bad that Clojure is missing out on these kinds of
          ecosystem benefits.</p>
          
          <p>Another subtler benefit frameworks bring is that they present a
          coherent story for how developers can build applications in your
          language, and that makes your language more attractive. Building an
          application means coordinating resources for the environment you're
          targeting (desktop, mobile, SPA, whatever). If your language has no
          frameworks for a target environment, then learning or using the
          language is much riskier. There's a much higher barrier to building
          products: not only does a dev have to learn the language's syntax
          and paradigms, she has to figure out how to perform the complex task
          of abstracting and coordinating resources using the language's
          paradigms. If your goal is to create a mass-market product, choosing a
          language that doesn't have frameworks for your target environments is
          a risky choice.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, frameworks become a base layer that you can create tooling
          for. The introduction of the filesystem made it possible for people to
          write tools that easily create and manipulate files. Rails's
          abstractions made it easy to generate code for creating a new database
          table, along with an entire stack - model, view, controller - for
          interacting with it.</p>
          
          <h3>Frameworks Make Development Fun</h3>
          
          <p>If you still think frameworks are overkill or more trouble than
          they're worth, believe me I get it. When I switched from Rails to
          Clojure and its "libraries not frameworks" approach, I <em>loved</em> it. A
          framework felt unnecessary because all the pieces were so simple that
          it was trivial for me to glue them together myself. Also, it was just
          plain fun to solve a problem I was familiar with because it helped me
          learn the language.</p>
          
          <p>Well, call me a jaded millenial fart, but I don't think that this work
          is fun anymore. I want to build products, not build the infrastructure
          for building products. I want a plugin that will handle the reset
          password process for me. I want an admin panel that I can get working
          in five minutes. Frameworks handle the kind of work that ideally only
          has to be done once. I don't want to have to do this work over and
          over every time I want to make something.</p>
          
          <p>For me, programming is a creative endeavor. I love making dumb things
          and putting them in front of people to see what will happen. Rails let
          me build (now defunct) sites like phobiatopia.com, where users could
          share what they're afraid of. The site would use their IP address to
          come up with some geo coordinates and use Google Maps to display a
          global fear map. A lot of people were afraid of bears.</p>
          
          <p>Frameworks let you focus on the fun parts of building an app. They let
          you release an idea, however dumb, more quickly.</p>
          
          <h3>Frameworks Help Beginners</h3>
          
          <p>Frameworks help beginners by empowering them to build real,
          honest-to-god running applications that they can show to their friends
          and even make money with, without having to fully understand or even
          be aware of all the technology they're using. Being able to conjure up
          a complete creation, no matter how small or ill-made, is the very
          breath of wonder and delight. (I don't know exactly what this means,
          but I like how it sounds!)</p>
          
          <p>There's a kind of thinking that says frameworks are bad because they
          allow beginners to make stuff without having to know how it all
          works. ActiveRecord is corrupting the youth, allowing them to build
          apps without even knowing how to pronounce <em>SQL</em>.</p>
          
          <p>There's another line of thinking that says it's bad to try to make
          things easier for beginners. It's somehow virtuous for people to
          struggle or suffer for the sake of learning.</p>
          
          <p>Hogwash. Fiddlefaddle. Poppycock. Joy beats suffering every time, and
          making learning more joyful allows more people to reap the benefits of
          whatever tool or product you've created.</p>
          
          <p>I am a photographer. I have a professional camera, and I know how to
          use it. Some of my photos require a fair amount of technical knowledge
          and specialized equipment:</p>
          
          <p><img src="/assets/images/posts/why-programmers-need-frameworks/tea.jpg" alt="tea"></p>
          
          <p>This isn't something you can create with a camera phone, yet somehow
          I'm able to enjoy myself and my art without complaining that
          point-and-shoot cameras exist and that people like them.</p>
          
          <p>Novices benefit greatly from expert guidance. I don't think you can
          become a master photographer using your phone's camera, but with the
          phone's "guidance" you can take some damn good photos and be proud of
          them. And if you do want to become a master, that kind of positive
          feedback and sense of accomplishment will give you the motivation to
          stick with it and learn the hard stuff. Frameworks provide this
          guidance by creating a safe path around all the quicksand and pit
          traps that you can stumble into when creating an app. Frameworks help
          beginners. This is a feature, not a bug.</p>
          
          <h2>A Clojure Framework</h2>
          
          <p>Frameworks are all about managing the complexity of coordinating
          resources. Well, guess what: Managing Complexity is Clojure's middle
          name. Clojure "Managing Complexity" McCarthy-Lisp. Personally, I want
          a single-page app (SPA) framework, and there are many aspects of
          Clojure's design and philosophy that I think will make it possible to
          create one that seriously kicks ass. I'll give just a few examples.</p>
          
          <p>First, consider how Linux tools like <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> are
          text-oriented. Developers can add additional structure to text by
          formatting it as JSON or YAML, and those text-processing tools can
          still work the structured text.</p>
          
          <p>In the same way, Clojure's emphasis on simple data structures means
          that we can create specialized structures to represent forms and ajax
          request, and tools to process those structures. If we define those
          structures in terms of maps and vectors, though, we'll still be able
          to use a vast ecosystem of functions for working with those simpler
          structures. In other words, creating specialized structures does not
          preclude us from using the tools built for simpler structures, and
          this isn't the case for many other languages.</p>
          
          <p>Second, Clojure's abstraction mechanisms (protocols and multimethods)
          are extremely flexible, making it easy for us to implement
          abstractions for new resources as they become available.</p>
          
          <p>Third, <em>you can use the same language for the frontend and backend!!!</em>
          Not only that, Transit allows the two to effortlessly
          communicate. This eliminates an entire class of coordination problems
          that frameworks in other languages have to contend with.</p>
          
          <p>In my opinion, the Clojurian stance that frameworks are more trouble
          than they're worth is completely backwards: Clojure gives us the
          foundation to build a completely kick-ass framework! One that's simple
          <em>and</em> easy. One can dream, right?</p>
          
          <p>My ambition in building a SPA framework is to empower current and
          future Clojure devs to get our ideas into production <em>fast</em>. I want us
          to be able to spend more time on the hard stuff, the fun stuff, the
          interesting stuff. And I want us to be able to easily ship with
          confidence.</p>
          
          <p>The framework I'm building is built on top of some truly amazing
          libraries, primarily Integrant, re-frame, and Liberator. Integrant
          introduces a <em>component</em> abstraction and handles the start/stop
          lifecycle of an application. re-frame provides a filesystem and
          communication broker for the frontend. Liberator introduces a standard
          model for handling HTTP requests.</p>
          
          <p>If my framework is useful at all it's because the creators of those
          tools have done all the heavy lifting. My framework introduces more
          resources and abstractions specific to creating single-page apps. For
          example, it creates an abstraction for wrapping AJAX requests so that
          you can easily display activity indicators when a request is
          active. It creates a form abstraction that handles all the plumbing of
          handling input changes and dispatching form submission, as well the
          entire form lifecycle of <em>fresh</em>, <em>dirty</em>, <em>submitted</em>, <em>invalid</em>,
          <em>succeeded</em>, etc. It imposes some conventions for organizing data.</p>
          
          <p>As I mentioned, the framework is not quite ready for public
          consumption yet becaause there's still a lot of churn while I work out
          ideas, and because there's basically no documentation, but I hope to
          release it in the near future.</p>
          
          <p>If you'd like to see a production app that uses the framework,
          however, I invite you to check out <a href="https://gratefulplace.com">Grateful
          Place</a>, a community site for people who
          want to support each other in growing resilience, peace, and joy by
          practicing compassion, gratitude, generosity, and other positive
          values. By joining, you're not just helping yourself, you're helping
          others by letting them know that you support them and share their
          values.</p>
          
          <p>Please click around and look at the snazzy loading animations. And if
          you feel so moved, please do join! I <em>love</em> getting to interact with
          people in that context of mutual support for shared values. One of the
          only things I care about more than Clojure is helping people develop
          the tools to navigate this crazy-ass world :D</p>
          
          <p>In the mean time, I'll keep working on getting this framework ready
          for public consumption. Expect another blawg article sharing some
          details on how Grateful Place is implemented. Then, eventually,
          hopefully, an actual announcement for the framework itself :)</p>
