          <h1>A Directory of Open Source Clojure Projects</h1>
          <div class='date'>20 March 2016</div>
          <p>Every now and again I'll come across a post where someone asks about
          getting involved in open source clojure projects. Because every
          question deserves a single-page app dedicated to its answer, I made
          <a href="http://open-source.braveclojure.com/">Open Source Clojure Projects</a>,
          a directory of active projects welcoming new contributors.</p>
          
          <p>Each project has (or should have) clear instructions on:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Developing the project locally</li>
          <li>Running tests if there are tests</li>
          <li>Contributing code (pull request? tests required?)</li>
          <li>Contacting other devs - slack, mailing list, IRC, etc</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Also, there's a "beginner-friendly" flag so that new Clojurists can
          easily find projects with tasks that are appropriate for their skill
          level.</p>
          
          <p>So far, 22 projects have been added, which is awesome. A random
          sampling:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>
          <a href="http://open-source.braveclojure.com/projects/milestones">milestones</a>,
          which generates the best possible schedule from a set of tasks</li>
          <li>
          <a href="http://open-source.braveclojure.com/projects/reverie">reverie</a>, a
          CMS for power users</li>
          <li>
          <a href="http://open-source.braveclojure.com/projects/scheje">Scheje</a>, a
          little Scheme on Top of Clojure (!!!)</li>
          <li>
          <a href="http://open-source.braveclojure.com/projects/system">system</a>, a
          friendly layer on top of Stuart Sierra's component library</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>If you have an open source project and want people to contribute,
          please <a href="http://open-source.braveclojure.com/projects/new">add it</a>!</p>
          
          <h2>The Stack</h2>
          
          <p>A few folks have asked me about what tools I used to create the
          site. I'll explain more below but briefly:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>The backend is a weird, unholy mess of fantastic classic libraries
          and sideshow code that I keep transplanting from one project to
          another so that I can answer the question <em>what kind of abomination
          will this morph into this time?</em>. The backend uses Github as a
          database, though, and that's pretty neat.</li>
          <li>The frontend uses re-frame and includes some form handling code that
          I'm proud of and that's actually worth stealing.</li>
          <li>Finally, there's also some code for deploying with Ansible that's
          worth stealing.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>In the time-honored fashion of technical blog posts everywhere, I'll
          now "dive in" and elaborate on each of those bullet points.</p>
          
          <h3>Backend</h3>
          
          <p>For the backend, the site uses ring, compojure, liberator, http-kit,
          and the weird set of tools that have accreted in my projects over the
          years. Even though the code footprint for the backend is pretty small,
          it's pretty idiosyncratic, containing handfuls of half-formed ideas I
          keep noodling around with. Hopefully someday soon I'll be able to
          really nail down my approach to backend dev and share it, because it
          <em>does</em> allow me to write apps quickly.</p>
          
          <p>One cool part of the site is that it uses a Github repo,
          <a href="https://github.com/braveclojure/open-source-projects">Open Source Projects</a>,
          as its database. Browse the <code>projects</code> directory and you can see every
          project that's listed on the site stored as an EDN file. When the
          backend starts up it reads from Github, and whenever someone posts or
          edits a listing it writes the EDN file using Github's API.</p>
          
          <p>The nice thing about this approach is that I didn't have to worry
          about standing up a server or keeping backups. And it was just fun to
          code. <a href="https://github.com/braveclojure/open-source/blob/master/src/backend/open_source/db/github.clj">Here's the source</a>
          for using Github as a db - I definitely see potential in reusing this
          approach for similar lightweight directory sites.</p>
          
          <h3>Frontend</h3>
          
          <p><a href="https://github.com/Day8/re-frame">re-frame</a> has a delightful README
          that gracefully introduces you to reactive programming. If you haven't
          read it then stop reading this article and read that instead; I am
          100% confident that it's a better use of your time.</p>
          
          <p>re-frame is a joy to use, and it's become my go-to tool for frontend
          projects. I've written a fair amount of code
          <a href="https://github.com/braveclojure/open-source/blob/master/src/frontend/open_source/components/form_helpers.cljs">for working with forms</a>
          and
          <a href="https://github.com/braveclojure/open-source/blob/master/src/frontend/open_source/handlers/common.cljs#L13">submitting values</a>. This
          code forms a kind of nano-framework on top of re-frame, and it's
          allowed me to speed up the development process from project to
          project. Here's
          <a href="https://github.com/braveclojure/open-source/blob/master/src/frontend/open_source/pub/projects/project_form.cljs">an example form which uses the form helpers</a>. If
          you'd like for me to write a detailed explanation of this code, please
          leave a comment letting me know :)</p>
          
          <p><a href="http://boot-clj.com/">Boot</a> deserves a special mention because it
          makes it so easy to develop ClojureScript apps. With Boot you get live
          reload (every time you change your frontend files, the changes are
          automatically injected into the browser), giving you a
          near-instantaneous feedback cycle that makes development much more
          enjoyable. It's also easy to incorporate <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>
          compilation - and your Sass files also get the live reload treatment.</p>
          
          <p>If you're not using Boot to build your ClojureScript app then chances
          are you're causing yourself undue suffering. And hey, maybe you're
          into that? No judgment. But if you're not, then take the time to learn
          it - it's a great investment in yourself as a Clojure developer.</p>
          
          <h3>Deployment</h3>
          
          <p>The
          <a href="https://github.com/braveclojure/open-source/tree/master/infrastructure">infrastructure</a>
          directory contains scripts for provisioning and deploying to a server
          with <a href="http://ansible.com/">Ansible</a>. It also has a
          <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrantfile</a> so that you can stand up a
          test server locally; just run <code>vagrant up</code> to both create the virtual
          machine and provision it. To deploy, <code>cd</code> into the <code>infrastructure</code>
          directory and run <code>./build.sh &amp;&amp; ./deploy-dev.sh</code>. Those two shell
          scripts are extemely simple, so take a look at them to see what's
          involved in deployment.</p>
          
          <p>The Ansible configuration is almost completely reusable. You can check
          it out in <code>infrastructure/ansible</code>. The <code>roles</code> directory in
          particular has Ansible tasks for creating an nginx server that can run
          Clojure app. It also includes an Upstart script for controlling
          startup/shutdown of your Clojure app (assuming you use Ubuntu).</p>
          
          <h2>The Future</h2>
          
          <p>Eventually, I'd like to add more tools for project discovery and for
          showing project stats. @yogthos, for example, suggested incorporating
          a project's stats from github so that users can see how active and
          popular each project is, information that can help them decide which
          project to contribute to.</p>
          
          <p>Also, I'm in the process of revamping
          <a href="http://braveclojure.com">braveclojure.com</a> to include more resources
          for Clojure programmers. The site hovers around 3rd or 4th Google
          result for "Clojure", just below clojure.org and the Wikipedia
          entry. So, it's kind of popular I guess. My hope is that by featuring
          Open Source Clojure Projects, I'll help more new developers get
          involved and also help project maintainers squash some tickets.</p>
