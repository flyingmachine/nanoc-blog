          <h1>Boot, the Fancy New Clojure Build Framework</h1>
          <div class='date'>15 February 2015</div>
          <p>Build tools are known to inspire the entire gamut of emotions from
          bored impatience to Homeric rage (I'm looking at you,
          Grunt). Personally, I've never given them much thought; they've always
          seemed like tedious overhead, an unfortunate necessity for getting
          <em>real</em> work done.</p>
          
          <p>Recently, though, I've started learning about
          <a href="http://boot-clj.com/">Boot</a>, and I've found that build programming
          can actually be interesting. This article will explain Boot's
          underlying concepts and guide you through writing your first Boot
          tasks. If you're interested in using Boot to build projects right this
          second, then check out its
          <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot">github README</a> and its
          <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>
          
          <h2>Boot's Abstractions</h2>
          
          <p>Created by Micha Niskin and Alan Dipert, Boot is a completely
          controversy-free addition to the Clojure tooling landscape. On the
          surface, it's "merely" a convenient way to build Clojure applications
          and run Clojure tasks from the command line. But dig a little deeper
          and you'll see that Boot is like the lisped-up lovechild of Git and
          Unix in that it provides abstractions that make it much more pleasant
          to write code that exists at the intersection of your operating system
          and your application.</p>
          
          <p>Unix provides abstractions that we're all familiar with to the point
          of taking them for granted. (I mean, would it kill you to take your
          computer out to a nice restaurant once in awhile?) The process
          abstraction allows you to reason about programs as isolated units of
          logic that can be easily composed into a stream-processing pipeline
          through the <code>STDIN</code> and <code>STDOUT</code> file descriptors. These abstractions
          make certain kinds of operations, like text processing, very easy.</p>
          
          <p>Similarly, Boot provides abstractions that make it actually pleasant
          to compose independent operations into the kinds of complex,
          coordinated operations that build tools end up doing, like converting
          Clojurescript into Javascript. Boot's <em>task</em> abstraction lets you
          easily define units of logic that communicate through <em>filesets</em>. The
          fileset abstraction keeps track of the evolving build context and it
          provides a well-defined, reliable method of task coordination, as
          opposed to the ill-defined, ad-hoc task coordination which programmers
          have to impose on other build tools.</p>
          
          <p>That's a lot of high-level description, which hopefully is great for
          when you want to hook someone's attention, which hopefully I have now
          done. But I would be ashamed to leave you with a plateful of
          metaphors. Oh no, dear reader; that was only the appetizer. For the
          rest of this article you will learn what that word salad means by
          building your own Boot tasks. Along the way, you'll discover that
          build tools can actually have a conceptual foundation.</p>
          
          <h2>Tasks</h2>
          
          <p>Like make, rake, grunt, and other build tools of yore, Boot lets you
          define <em>tasks</em>. Tasks are</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>named operations</li>
          <li>that take command line options</li>
          <li>dispatched by some intermediary program (make, rake, Boot)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Boot provides the dispatching program, <code>boot</code>, and a Clojure library
          that makes it easy for you to define named operations and their
          command line options with the <code>deftask</code> macro. So that you can see
          what all the fuss is about, it's time to create your first
          task. Normally, programming tutorials encourage have you write
          something that prints "Hello World", but I like my examples to have
          real-world utility, so your task is going to print "My pants are on
          fire!", information which is objectively more useful. First,
          <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot#install">install Boot</a>, then create
          a new directory named <code>boot-walkthrough</code>, navigate to that directory,
          and finally create a file named <code>build.boot</code> and put in this in it:</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">deftask</span> <span class="nv">fire</span>&#x000A;  <span class="s">"Prints 'My pants are on fire!'"</span>&#x000A;  <span class="p">[]</span>&#x000A;  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">println </span><span class="s">"My pants are on fire!"</span><span class="p">))</span></pre></div>
          <p>Now run this task with <code>boot fire</code>; you should see the message you
          wrote printed to your terminal. This demonstrates two out of the three
          task components - the task is named (<code>fire</code>) and it's dispatched by
          <code>boot</code>. This is already super cool â€“ you've essentially created
          a Clojure script, standalone Clojure code that you can easily run from
          the command line. No <code>project.clj</code> or directory structure or
          namespaces needed!</p>
          
          <p>Let's extend the example to demonstrate how you'd write command line
          options:</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">deftask</span> <span class="nv">fire</span>&#x000A;  <span class="s">"Announces that something is on fire"</span>&#x000A;  <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">t</span> <span class="nv">thing</span>     <span class="nv">THING</span> <span class="nb">str </span> <span class="s">"The thing that's on fire"</span>&#x000A;   <span class="nv">p</span> <span class="nv">pluralize</span>       <span class="nv">bool</span> <span class="s">"Whether to pluralize"</span><span class="p">]</span>&#x000A;  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">verb</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="nv">pluralize</span> <span class="s">"are"</span> <span class="s">"is"</span><span class="p">)]</span>&#x000A;    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">println </span><span class="s">"My"</span> <span class="nv">thing</span> <span class="nv">verb</span> <span class="s">"on fire!"</span><span class="p">)))</span></pre></div>
          <p>Try running the task like so:</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre>boot fire -t heart&#x000A;<span class="c"># =&gt; My heart is on fire!</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;boot fire -t logs -p&#x000A;<span class="c"># =&gt; My logs are on fire!</span></pre></div>
          <p>In the first instance, either you're newly in love or you need to be
          rushed to the emergency room. In the second, you are a boy scout
          awkwardly exclaiming your excitement over meeting the requirements for
          a merit badge. In both instances, you were able to easily specify
          options for the task.</p>
          
          <p>This refinement of the <code>fire</code> task introduced two command line
          options, <code>thing</code> and <code>pluralize</code>. These options are defined using the
          options DSL. In the case of <code>thing</code>, <code>t</code> specifies the option's short
          name and <code>thing</code> specifies the long name. <code>THING</code> is a little
          complicated, and I'll get to it in a second. <code>str</code> specifies the
          option's type, and Boot uses that both to validate the argument and
          convert it. <code>"The thing that's on fire"</code> is the documentation for the
          option. You can view a task's documentation with <code>boot task-name -h</code>:</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre>boot fire -h&#x000A;<span class="c"># Announces that something is on fire</span>&#x000A;<span class="c"># </span>&#x000A;<span class="c"># Options:</span>&#x000A;<span class="c">#   -h, --help         Print this help info.</span>&#x000A;<span class="c">#   -t, --thing THING  Set the thing that's on fire to THING.</span>&#x000A;<span class="c">#   -p, --pluralize    Whether to pluralize</span></pre></div>
          <p>Pretty groovy! Boot makes it very, very easy to write code that's
          meant to be invoked from the command line.</p>
          
          <p>Now, about <code>THING</code>. <code>THING</code> is an <em>optarg</em> and it indicates that this
          option expects an argument. You don't have to include an optarg when
          you're defining an option (notice that the <code>pluralize</code> option has no
          optarg). The optarg doesn't have to correspond to the full name of the
          option; you could replace <code>THING</code> with <code>BILLY_JOEL</code> or whatever you
          want and the task would work the same. Finally, you can also designate
          <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Task-Options-DSL#complex-options">complex options</a>
          using the optarg. (That link will take you to Boot's documentation on
          the subject.) Basically, complex options allow you to specify that
          option arguments should be treated as as maps, sets, vectors, or even
          nested collections. It's pretty powerful.</p>
          
          <p>Boot provides you with all the tools you could ask for in building
          command-line interfaces with Clojure. And you've only just started
          learning about it!</p>
          
          <h2>The REPL</h2>
          
          <p>Boot comes with a good number of useful built-in tasks, including a
          REPL task; run <code>boot repl</code> to fire up that puppy. The Boot REPL is
          similar to Leiningen's in that it handles loading your project code so
          that you can play around with it. You might not think this applies to
          the project you've been writing because you've only written tasks, but
          you can actually run tasks in the REPL (I've left out the
          <code>boot.user=&gt;</code> prompt):</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">;; pass arguments as flags</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">fire</span> <span class="s">"-t"</span> <span class="s">"NBA Jam guy"</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1">; My NBA Jam guy is on fire!</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1">;=&gt; nil</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="c1">;; or as keywords</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">fire</span> <span class="ss">:thing</span> <span class="s">"NBA Jam guy"</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1">; My NBA Jam guy is on fire!</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1">;=&gt; nil</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">fire</span> <span class="s">"-p"</span> <span class="s">"-t"</span> <span class="s">"NBA Jam guys"</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1">; My NBA Jam guys are on fire!</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1">;=&gt; nil</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">fire</span> <span class="ss">:pluralize</span> <span class="nv">true</span> <span class="ss">:thing</span> <span class="s">"NBA Jam guys"</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1">; My NBA Jam guys are on fire!</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1">;=&gt; nil</span></pre></div>
          <p>And of course, you can also use <code>deftask</code> in the REPL â€“ it's just
          Clojure, after all. The takeaway is that Boot lets you interact with
          your tasks as Clojure functions, because that's what they are.</p>
          
          <h2>Composition and Coordination</h2>
          
          <p>If what you've seen so far was all that Boot had to offer, it'd be a
          pretty swell tool, though not very different from other build
          tools. One thing that sets Boot apart, though, is how it lets you
          compose tasks. For comparison's sake, here's an example Rake
          invocation (Rake is the premier Ruby build tool):</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="vg">rake</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">db:</span><span class="vg">create</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">db:</span><span class="vg">migrate</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">db:</span><span class="vg">seed</span></pre></div>
          <p>In case you were wondering, this will create a database, run
          migrations on it, and populate it with seed data when run in a Rails
          project. What's worth noting, however, is that Rake doesn't provide
          any way for these tasks to communicate with each other. Specifying
          multiple tasks is just a convenience, saving you from having to run
          <code>rake db:create; rake db:migrate; rake db:seed</code>. If you want to access
          the result of Task A within Task B, the build tool doesn't help you;
          you have to manage that coordination yourself. Usually, you'll do this
          by shoving the result of Task A into a special place on the
          filesystem, and then making sure Task B reads that special place.
          This looks like programming with mutable, global variables, and it's
          just as brittle.</p>
          
          <h2>Handlers and Middleware</h2>
          
          <p>Boot addresses this problem by treating tasks as <em>middleware
          factories</em>. If you're familiar with
          <a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a>, Boot's tasks work very
          similarly; feel free to skip to the next section.  If you're not
          familiar with the concept of middleware, then allow me to explain!
          First, the term <em>middleware</em> refers to a set of <em>conventions</em> that
          programmers adhere to so that they can <em>flexibly create
          domain-specific function pipelines</em>. That's pretty dense, so let's
          un-dense it. I'll go over the <em>flexible</em> part in this section, and
          cover <em>domain-specific</em> in the next.</p>
          
          <p>To understand how the middleware approach differs from run-of-the-mill
          function composition, here's an example of composing everyday
          functions:</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">strinc</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">comp str </span><span class="nv">inc</span><span class="p">))</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">strinc</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1">; =&gt; "4"</span></pre></div>
          <p>There's nothing interesting about this function composition. This
          function composition is so unremarkable that it strains my abilities
          as a writer to try and actually say anything about it. There are two
          functions, each doing its own thing, and now they've been been
          composed into one. Whoop-dee-do!</p>
          
          <p>Middleware introduce an extra step to function composition, and this
          gives you more flexibility in defining your function
          pipeline. Suppose, in the example above, that you wanted to return <code>"I&#x000A;don't like the number X"</code> for arbitrary numbers, but still return the
          stringified number for everything else. Here's how you could do that:</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">whiney-str</span>&#x000A;  <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">rejects</span><span class="p">]</span>&#x000A;  <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:pre</span> <span class="p">[(</span><span class="nf">set?</span> <span class="nv">rejects</span><span class="p">)]}</span>&#x000A;  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">fn </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">]</span>&#x000A;    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">rejects</span> <span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="s">"I don't like "</span> <span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">))))</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">whiney-strinc</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">comp </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">whiney-str</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">})</span> <span class="nv">inc</span><span class="p">))</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">whiney-strinc</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1">; =&gt; "I don't like 2 :'("</span></pre></div>
          <p>Now let's take it one step further. What if you want to decide whether
          or not to call <code>inc</code> in the first place? Here's how you could do that:</p>

          <p>Here, instead of using <code>comp</code> to create your function pipeline, you
          pass the next function in the pipeline as the first argument to the
          middleware function. In this case, you're passing <code>inc</code> as the first
          argument to <code>whiney-middleware</code>. <code>whiney-middleware</code> then returns an
          anonymous functions which closes over <code>inc</code> and has the ability to
          choose whether to call it or not. You can see this at <code>~1~</code>.</p>
          
          <p>We say that middleware take a <em>handler</em> as their first argument, and
          return a handler. In the example above, <code>whiney-middleware</code> takes a
          handler as its first argument, <code>inc</code> here, and it returns another
          handler, the anonymous function with <code>x</code> as its only
          argument. Middleware can also take extra arguments, like <code>rejects</code>,
          that act as configuration. The result is that the handler returned by
          the middleware can behave more flexibly (thanks to configuration) and
          it has more control over the function pipeline (because it can choose
          whether or not to call the next handler).</p>
          
          <h2>Tasks are Middleware Factories</h2>
          
          <p>Boot takes this pattern one step further by separating middleware
          configuration from handler creation. First, you create a function
          which takes <em>n</em> many configuration arguments. This is the <em>middleware
          factory</em> and it returns a middleware function. The middleware function
          expects one argument, the next handler, and it returns a handler, just
          like in the example above. Here's a whiney middleware factory:</p>

          <p>As you can see, it's nearly identical to the previous example. The
          change is that the topmost function, <code>whiney-middleware-factory</code>, now
          only accepts one argument, <code>rejects</code>. It returns an anonymous
          function, the middleware, which expects one argument, a handler. The
          rest of the code is the same.</p>
          
          <p>In Boot, tasks can act as middleware factories. In fact, they usually
          do, I just didn't present them that way above in order to keep things
          simple. To show this, let's split the <code>fire</code> task into two tasks:
          <code>what</code> and <code>fire</code>. <code>what</code> will let you specify an object and whether
          it's plural, and <code>fire</code> will announce that it's on fire. This is
          great, modular software engineering because it allows you to add other
          tasks like <code>gnomes</code>, to announce that a thing is being overrun with
          gnomes, which is just as objectively useful. (Exercise for the reader:
          create the <code>gnome</code> task.)</p>

          <p>Wait a minute, what's that <code>boot</code> call doing there? In Micha's words,
          "The <code>boot</code> macro takes care of setup and cleanup (creating the
          initial fileset, stopping servers started by tasks, things like
          that). Tasks are functions so you can call them directly, but if they
          use the fileset they will fail unless you call them via the boot
          macro." Wait a minute, what's a fileset?</p>
          
          <h2>Filesets</h2>
          
          <p>I mentioned earlier that middleware are for creating <em>domain-specific</em>
          function pipelines. All that means is that each handler expects to
          receive domain-specific data, and returns domain-specific data. With
          Ring, for example, each handler expects to receive a <em>request map</em>
          representing the HTTP request. This might look something like:</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:server-port</span> <span class="mi">80</span>&#x000A; <span class="ss">:request-method</span> <span class="ss">:get</span>&#x000A; <span class="ss">:scheme</span> <span class="ss">:http</span><span class="p">}</span></pre></div>
          <p>Each handler can choose to modify this request map in some way before
          passing it on to the next handler, say by adding a <code>:params</code> key with
          a nice Clojure map of all query string and POST parameters. Ring
          handlers return a <em>response map</em>, which consists of the keys
          <code>:status</code>, <code>:headers</code>, and <code>:body</code>, and once again each handler can
          transform this data in some way before returning it to its parent
          handler.</p>
          
          <p>In Boot, each handlers receives and returns a
          <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Filesets"><em>fileset</em></a>.  The
          fileset abstraction gives you a way to treat files on your filesystem
          as immutable data, and this is a great innovation for build tools
          because building projects is so file-centric. For example, your
          project might need to place temporary, intermediary files on the
          filesystem. Usually, with build tools that aren't Boot, these files
          get placed in some specially-named place, say,
          <code>project/target/tmp</code>. The problem with this is that
          <code>project/target/tmp</code> is effectively a global variable, and other tasks
          can accidentally muck it up.</p>
          
          <p>The fileset abstraction works by adding a layer of indirection on top
          of the filesystem. Let's say Task A creates File X and tells the
          fileset to store it. Behind the scenes, the fileset stores the file in
          an anonymous, temporary directory. The fileset then gets passed to
          Task B, and Task B modifies File X and asks the fileset to store the
          result. Behind the scenes, a new file, File Y, is created and stored,
          but File X remains untouched. In Task B, an updated fileset is
          returned. This is the equivalent of doing <code>assoc-in</code> with a map; Task
          A can still access the original fileset and the files it references.</p>
          
          <p>The mechanics of working with filesets are all explained in
          <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Filesets">the fileset wiki</a>,
          but I hope this gives a good conceptual overview!</p>
          
          <h2>Everything else</h2>
          
          <p>The point of this article was to explain the concepts behind
          Boot. However, it also has a bunch of features, like <code>set-env!</code> and
          <code>task-options!</code> that make life easier when you're actually using
          it. It does <em>amazing magical things</em> like <em>providing classpath isolation
          so that you can run multiple projects using one JVM</em> and <em>letting you
          add new dependencies to your project without having to restart your
          REPL</em>.  If Boot tickles your fancy, check out its
          <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot">README</a> for more info on real-world
          usage. Also, its <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki">wiki</a>
          provides top-notch documentation.</p>
