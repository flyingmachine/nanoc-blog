          <h1>Clojure Conj 2014 - Thank Yous, Noir Recommendations, Personal Highlights</h1>
          <div class='date'>23 November 2014</div>
          <p>This year's Clojure Conj was a complete blast! I got to meet and
          reconnect with great, friendly, brilliant people, and had enormous fun
          the whole time. And by the way - if you were hoping to get a sticker,
          please email me at
          <a href="mailto:daniel@flyingmachinestudios.com">daniel@flyingmachinestudios.com</a>
          and let me know how I can get one to you!</p>
          
          <p>The main thing I want to say is THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who went
          out of their way to share their appreciation for Clojure for the Brave
          and True; I know how easy it is to feel nervous about approaching a
          stranger! The book is a labor of love, an attempt at both expressing
          myself creatively and bringing joy to others through entertainment and
          education, and it is immensely gratifying to hear that my efforts are
          paying off. Putting myself out there over and over with each chapter
          and revision is nervewracking as hell, but y'all really make me feel
          like it's worth it. I have to admit, though, that I'm finding it hard
          to adjust back to normal life. Why aren't the other people waiting in
          this airport with me coming up and thanking me? Don't they know who I
          am!?!? Seriously, though - thanks everybody, and I hope you're enjoying your
          Clojure journey :)</p>
          
          <p>Second, I'm grateful to Alex Miller
          (<a href="https://twitter.com/puredanger">@puredanger</a>), Cognitect, and all of
          the excellent speakers for creating such a great experience for
          everyone. Send them your thanks, and go watch the talks at
          <a href="https://t.co/0YyJNkC6lH">the ClojureTV YouTube channel</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Did anyone else freaking <em>love</em> the crime museum? What an awesome
          choice for a party venue! If you're into noir/hardboiled
          entertainment, here are some recommendations:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356777/">True Detective</a> - I am
          completely nuts over the first season. The acting is superb, and the
          storytelling is some of the best you'll see in any TV show or
          movie. It actually ruined all TV for me - it was out around the same
          time as The Walking Dead, and it made The Walking Dead feel clunky
          and boring. This is the gold standard for noir entertainment.</li>
          <li>
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sleeper-Omnibus-Ed-Brubaker/dp/1401238033/">Sleeper</a>,
          a gritty graphic novel by Ed Brubaker. Also check out his "Fatale"
          and "Criminal" series. His works are suspenseful and heartbreaking,
          with great art and great storytelling.</li>
          <li>
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hard-Magic-Book-Grimnoir-Chronicles-ebook/dp/B00APAHLMA">Hard Magic / The Grimnoir Chronicles</a>
          Frankly, I expected this book to be complete trash, but man did it
          grab me! I came away incredibly impressed at the author's ability to
          craft an action-packed novel that actually had depth with prose that
          exceeds most literary works.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Now, normally I try to write stuff that's useful for readers, but the
          rest of this post is essentially fanboi raving because OMG I got to
          meet Bozhidar Batsov! Bozhidar is the Emacs Knight we need, and holy
          crap I got a private <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a>
          lesson from him. Expect an article on all the cool CIDER features
          you're not using in the near future.</p>
          
          <p>Other fanboi highlights:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Getting to real-life meet Mike Marsh, one of the most prolific
          posters on <a href="http://www.gratefulplace.com">Grateful Place</a> and a
          thoughtful, smart, and genuine good guy.</li>
          <li>Meeting Brian Jennings, the man responsible for Emacs 24.4's
          lose-focus hooks. He gets about a million geek points for persuading
          the Emacs team, including and especially RMS, that the feature was a
          good idea. How cool is that?</li>
          <li>Totally bombing one of my programming jokes with a Clojure
          Olympian. That gets me geek points, right? Right? Eh? Eh?</li>
          <li>Hearing about a cool swarm intelligence project from a college
          hacker, Anthony, who also happens to be an awesome dude</li>
          <li>Spending time with Isaac Praveen and the rest of the
          <a href="http://www.staples-sparx.com/">Sparx</a> team. Thanks for the drink,
          and thanks for the company! These guys are doing cool stuff and they
          are hiring Clojure devs.</li>
          <li>Meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/angelaharms">Angela Harms</a> and
          <a href="https://twitter.com/eraserhd">Jason Felice</a>, my new Buddha
          buddies. I'm hoping to see a lot of cool stuff at
          <a href="http://maitria.com/">Maitria</a> :D</li>
          <li>Talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/opinionsonline">Johann Bestowrous (@opinionsonline)</a> -
          do yourself a big favor and follow him on twitter, he is a funny
          dude</li>
          <li>Getting a sneak peek at the next version of
          <a href="https://www.hostelrocket.com/">Hostel Rocket</a>. These guys are also
          hiring Clojure Devs, and they have a really cool product.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>It was great hanging out with folks, and I hope everybody had a safe
          trip home!</p>
