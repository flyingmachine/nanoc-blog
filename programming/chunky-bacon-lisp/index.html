          <div class='date'>03 March 2012</div>
          <h2>Ruby is Awesome</h2>
          
          <p>Like many Rubyists, I came to the language through Rails while fleeing
          the horror of convoluted PHP sphagetti hell. For web development, the
          Rails framework was a relief; for programming, Ruby was a revelation.</p>
          
          <p>When asked, most other Ruby programmers I know will say they feel the
          same way. Ruby was
          <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/rubyP.html">designed to make programmers happy</a>
          and it shows. Ruby is remarkably free of cruft. Its succinctness and
          cohesion allow you to go from idea to implementation quickly.</p>
          
          <p>What this all boils down to is that Ruby requires far less "mental
          overhead", leaving room for creative problem solving. Our memories and
          attention spans are limited, and every time we get caught up in the
          weird minutiae of a programming language we're likely to forget what
          we were trying to do in the first place. We then need to piece
          together our original purpose and plan of attack, breaking our flow
          and causing frustration. Because Ruby introduces less of a cognitive
          burden, we're able to stay "in the zone" longer and experience the
          pleasure of creativity.</p>
          
          <p>In addition to its design, Ruby offers power and flexibility. As in
          the old Perl mantra, it makes easy things easy and hard things
          possible through such features as closures, meta programming, mixins,
          message passing and "duck typing". All of these ideas were new to me
          back in 2005 when I got my first taste of Ruby, and it was so exciting
          to learn about them and use them that for months I spent almost every
          morning and evening seeing what I could do with this awesome language.</p>
          
          <h2>Lisp is Awesome</h2>
          
          <p>It's been awhile since I've felt this excited about a
          language. Javascript, which I pretty much learned in tandem with Ruby,
          was a lot of fun. Objective-C was frustrating because I didn't know C
          and couldn't find a comprehensive guide to the mammoth framework(s?)
          used for cocoa development. Learning C was a fun challenge and it's
          been useful in understanding Unix, but it hasn't really sustained my
          interest.</p>
          
          <p>And now I've met Lisp. Common Lisp, to be exact. And I find myself
          just as excited as when I started learning Ruby. I don't even really
          know what I would use the language <em>for</em> - it's just fun to learn it
          and see what I can do. For the time being, I've been occupying myself
          with implementing
          <a href="https://github.com/flyingmachine/minimax-tictactoe">Tic-Tac-Toe in Lisp and Ruby</a>,
          as I wrote about in my <a href="/programming/minimax">article on minimax</a>. (By
          the way - I plan on writing an article comparing the two versions.)
          Next I plan to optimize those implementations a little bit, and after
          that I shall work on my magnum opus: <em>Hobbit vs. Giant</em>.</p>
          
          <p>But back to Lisp. Like with Ruby, the language does not get in my
          way. And just like when I came from PHP, I'm finding myself with a
          wealth of new ideas and programming tools to play with. Generic
          functions and classes, multi-methods, first-class treatment of
          functions and closures - the list could go on. But chief among Lisp's
          features is the mighty <em>macro</em>.</p>
          
          <h2>Macros are Awesome</h2>
          
          <p>One thing that really blew my mind about Ruby is the power you get
          from its meta-programming. Though I've barely scratched the surface in
          Lisp, I have the sense that Lisp's macro system offers <em>so much more</em>.</p>
          
          <p>It's hard for me to explain why I think macros are cool except by
          analogy. So - consider that, in Ruby, everything is an object. This
          simplifying concept reduces cognitive burden, but it also means that
          you can extend Ruby's power to everything. You can open up the String
          class and define methods on it because it's just a class like every
          other.</p>
          
          <p>In Lisp, code is data. What this means is that the code you write to
          do stuff takes the same form as the code you write to represent a
          basic Lisp data structure, the list. For example, this is how you
          would add two numbers in Lisp:</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>
          <p>Now consider how you would write a list constant:</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">'(+ 1 2)</span></pre></div>
          <p>The single quote indicates, "Don't evaluate me, just use me as data".</p>
          
          <p>Because the code that you write in order to <em>do stuff</em> takes the same
          form as a list, Lisp is able to treat code as data and use the full
          power of the language to manipulate your code.</p>
          
          <p>This is what gives macros their power. By contrast, in Ruby you
          perform metaprogramming largely through string manipulation and
          symbols, As Peter Seibel explains in <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/macros-defining-your-own.html">Practical Common
          Lisp</a>:</p>
          <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="vg">The</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">key</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">understanding</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">macros</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">is</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">be</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">quite</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">clear</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">about</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">the</span>&#x000A;<span class="vg">distinction</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">between</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">code</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">that</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">generates</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">code</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vg">macros</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">and</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">code</span>&#x000A;<span class="vg">that</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">eventually</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">makes</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">up</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">program</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vg">everything</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">else</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">When</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">you</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">write</span>&#x000A;<span class="vg">macros</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">you</span><span class="c1">'re writing programs that will be used by the compiler to</span>&#x000A;<span class="vg">generate</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">code</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">that</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">will</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">then</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">be</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">compiled</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">Only</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">after</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">all</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">the</span>&#x000A;<span class="vg">macros</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">have</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">been</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">fully</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">expanded</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">and</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">resulting</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">code</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">compiled</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">can</span>&#x000A;<span class="vg">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">program</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">actually</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">be</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">run</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">The</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">time</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">when</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">macros</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">run</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">is</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">called</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">macro</span>&#x000A;<span class="vg">expansion</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">time</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">this</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">is</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">distinct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">runtime</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">when</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">regular</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">code</span><span class="p">,</span>&#x000A;<span class="vg">including</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">code</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">generated</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">by</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">macros</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vg">runs</span><span class="o">.</span></pre></div>
          <p>As I write this, I find that I'm not really doing the subject
          justice. That's probably inevitable. Before really learning what
          closures are and how to use them, most Rubyists probably didn't see
          what the big deal was. However, I hope that this explanation might
          inspire other Rubyists did give this language a try. My guess is that
          most who really give it a shot will come to enjoy it as I do. The
          point is that Lisp offers a great deal of power and flexibility in an
          elegant package, all language aspects that Rubyists appreciate. The
          territory is worth exploring.</p>
          
          <h2>Lisp Resources</h2>
          
          <p>To get started, I recommend
          <a href="http://amzn.to/1MyWXUg">Land of Lisp: Learn to Program in Lisp, One Game at a Time!</a>. I
          would say that it rivals _why's book in fun, creativity, and
          usefulness.</p>
          
          <p>As a follow-up, I recommend the aforementioned
          <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a>. It's also a
          good choice to get started immediately as it's available online for
          free. (Incidentally, it's quite pleasant to read as the typography is
          good.) It's similar to the Pickaxe in that it gives a much more
          thorough and straightforward explanation of the language. It has
          really helped me fill in the gaps. The following resources are also
          useful:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>
          <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/lisp">r/lisp</a> - It's fun to see what's going on in the lisp world. The community has also been friendly and helpful.</li>
          <li>
          <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">The Common Lisp HyperSpec</a> - The master CL reference.</li>
          <li>
          <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a> - Paul Graham's
          classic, for free. I haven't actually started this one yet but I'll
          be going through it next.</li>
          <li>
          <a href="http://amzn.to/1Ww8AWV">Let Over Lambda</a> - I've only just started this and it's probably too advanced for me, but holy crap is it exciting to read!</li>
