          <p><img src="/assets/images/posts/rich-hickey-function.png" alt="The Rich Hickey Function"></p>
          
          <p>Part of my excitement in learning Clojure has been being exposed to
          Rich Hickey's thoughts on programming. Rich Hickey has a clear,
          consistent way of viewing fundamental programming concepts that I
          think any programmer would benefit from. Every time I watch one of his
          talks, I feel like someone has gone in and organized my brain.</p>
          
          <p>In this article (and more to come (possibly)), I begin my attempt to
          catalog Mr. Hickey's unique viewpoint. Eventually, I would like to
          produce a concise summary of his ideas. My hope is that this will
          provide an easily-scannable reference to Clojurists and an accessible
          introduction to non-Clojurists.</p>
          
          <p>What follows is derived from Rich Hickey's talk,
          "<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey">Are we there yet?</a>"</p>
          
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          
          <p>Today's OOP languages - Ruby, Java, Python, etc. - are fundamentally
          flawed. They introduce
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">accidental complexity</a>
          by building on an inaccurate model of reality. Where they have
          explicit definitions for the following concepts, the definitions are
          wrong:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Value</li>
          <li>State</li>
          <li>Identity</li>
          <li>Time</li>
          <li>Behavior</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Below, we'll contrast the OOP viewpoint on each of these topics with
          the Functional Programming viewpoint. But first, we'll compare the
          models of reality which underlie OOP and FP. It's this underlying
          difference which gives rise to their different approach to the topics
          above.</p>
          
          <h2>Metaphysics, Programming, and You: Comparing OOP and FP</h2>
          
          <p>When talking about metaphysics things tend to get a little fuzzy, but
          hopefully this will all make sense.</p>
          
          <p>As the ever-trusty
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics">Wikipedia</a> explains,
          metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions in the broadest
          possible terms:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>What is there?</li>
          <li>What is it like?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Rich Hickey explains the difference between OOP and FP metaphysics by
          contrasting their explanations of what a river is. </p>
          
          <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
          
          <p>In OOP metaphysics, a river is something which actually exists in the
          world. I know, I know, I can hear what you're saying: "Uh... yeah?
          So?" But believe me, the accuracy of that statement has caused many a
          sleepless night for philosophers.</p>
          
          <p>The wrinkle is that the river is always changing. Its water never
          ceases to flow. In OOP terms, we would say that it has mutable state,
          and that its state is ever fluctuating.</p>
          
          <p>The fact that the state of the River Object and that Objects in
          general are never stable doesn't stop us from nevertheless treating
          them as the fundamental building blocks of programs. In fact, this is
          seen as an advantage of OOP - it doesn't matter how the state changes,
          you can still interact with a stable interface and all will work as it
          should. An object can change, but to all observers it is still
          considered the same object.</p>
          
          <p>This conforms to our intuitive sense of the world. The position of the
          electrons of the coffee in my mug matters naught; the coffee still
          interacts with my taste buds in the way I expect.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, in OOP, objects do things. They act on each other. Again, this
          conforms to our intuitive sense of the world: change is the
          result of objects acting upon each other. A Person object pushes on a
          Door object and enters a House object.</p>
          
          <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
          
          <p><img src="/assets/images/posts/fp-metaphysics.png" alt="FP Metaphysics"></p>
          
          <p>In FP metaphysics, we would say that we never step in the same river
          twice. What we see as a discrete <em>thing</em> which actually exists in the
          world independent of its mutations is in reality a succession of
          discrete, unchanging things.</p>
          
          <p>The "river" is not a thing in and of itself; it's a concept
          that we superimpose on a succession of related phenomena. This concept
          is very useful - I won't belabor that point - but it is just a
          concept.</p>
          
          <p>What really exists are atoms (in the sense of atomic, unchanging,
          stable entities) and processes. The river is not a stable object;
          rather, it is a succession of related atoms which are generated by
          some kind of process.</p>
          
          <p>These atoms don't act upon each other and they can't be changed. They
          can't <em>do</em> anything. Change is not the result of one object acting on
          another; change is the result of a process being applied to an
          unchangeable atom. To say that something has changed is to say, "Oh,
          there's a new atom in this stream of atoms." It's like saying that
          HEAD points to a new commit in your Git repo.</p>
          
          <p>OK! Enough with metaphysics. Now let's describe the more immediately
          useful topics, starting with Value.</p>
          
          <h2>Value</h2>
          
          <p>It's obvious that numbers like 3 and 6 and 42 are values. Numbers are
          stable, unchanging.</p>
          
          <p>It should also be obvious that OO languages have "no proper notion" of
          values in this sense. As Rich Hickey points out, you can create a
          class whose instances are composed of immutable components, but there
          is no high-level concept of immutable value implemented as a first
          class construct within the class.</p>
          
          <p>This is one of the main causes of headaches when doing OOP. How many
          times have you pulled your hair out trying to figure out how an
          object's attribute got changed? The fact is, in OO languages there is
          no built-in mechanism to ensure that the object you're dealing with is
          stable.</p>
          
          <p>This is the big reason why concurrent programming is so difficult.
          Even in single-threaded programs this is a problem, and it's one of
          the reasons why we develop sprawling test suites. You can't be sure if
          a method call on your Toupee object is somehow going to cause a change
          in your HipsterGlasses object.</p>
          
          <p>By contrast, in FP languages emphasis is placed on working with
          immutable values. Since these values can't change, a whole class of
          problems simply disappears.</p>
          
          <h2>Identity</h2>
          
          <p>In the video, Mr. Hickey says:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>The biggest problem we have is we've conflated two things. We've
          said the <em>idea</em> that I attach to this thing that lasts over time
          <em>is</em> the thing that lasts over time.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>In FP, identity is essentially a name we give to a sequence of related
          atoms. "River" refers to the sequence R1, R2, R3, etc, produced by the
          river process. This is directly analogous to HEAD in Git - it's just a
          name which is used to refer to actual values. In OO, there really
          isn't such a distinction.</p>
          
          <p>Or as the man himself says, </p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>Identity is a putative entity we associate with a series of causally
          related values (states) over time. It's a label, a construct we use
          to collect a time series.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <h2>State</h2>
          
          <p>In OO, there is no real clear definition of state. Maybe it's, "the
          values of all the attributes within an object right now." And it has
          to be "right now", because there's no language-supported way of
          holding on to the past.</p>
          
          <p>This becomes clearer if you contrast it with the notion of identity in
          FP. In the Hickeysian universe, a State is a specific value for an
          identity at a point in time. (For me, this definition really clarified
          my own thoughts.)</p>
          
          <h2>Time</h2>
          
          <p>There's no real notion of time in OO. Everything's just "right now".
          This is part of what causes problems in concurrent programs.</p>
          
          <p>By contrast, in the FP worldview we've been exploring, time is
          well-defined. Time is a by-product of ordering states within an
          identity.</p>
          
          <p>(By the way, I'd really like to write more here, and would appreciate
          any suggestions.)</p>
          
          <h2>Behavior</h2>
          
          <p>Finally, behavior. I don't have too much to write here - I might need
          to watch some more talks - but I'll include Mr. Hickey's
          thought-provoking observation:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>There is no behavior. When you get hit by lightning, who's behaving?</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This may be what inspired Steve Yegge's post,
          <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html">Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns</a>.</p>
          
          <h2>The End</h2>
          
          <p>Well, that's it for now. I hope you've found this post useful. If you
          have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!</p>
