          <h1>Timeless Programming Tools</h1>
          <div class='date'>23 March 2016</div>
          <p>I've been programming professionally for a dozen years. Some of what
          I've learned is best forgotten (oh god, Cold Fusion), but there have
          been many tools, techniques, and concepts that continue to be useful
          every day. Here are mine; I'd love to hear what yours are so I can
          experience both the joy of discovery and regret for not learning about
          the tool earlier.</p>
          
          <h3>Relational Algebra / SQL</h3>
          
          <p>I feel lucky that, during my fourteenth summer, I apparently had no
          friends and so had nothing better to do than try and slog through
          <a href="http://amzn.to/1RyFQ7z">a book on MySQL and the now-defunct mSQL</a>. You
          can see from the reviews that the book "is sketchy, incomplete, and
          almost totally useless." But, it did introduce me to SQL and
          databases. Soon after, I learned relational algebra (the theory
          underlying RDBMSs) and that investment has been one of the best of my
          life. I can't count the number of times a <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code> has saved
          my bacon. Friends be damned!</p>
          
          <p>Learning relational algebra provided the foundation I needed to move
          easily from MySQL to Oracle and MS SQL Server when I joined
          EnterpriseCo, and in general knowing how to interact with databases
          without a framework or ORM helped me quickly advance career-wise. It's
          why, at 20, I was able to land a contract building a custom site for
          the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, instead of just cobbling together
          Wordpress and Drupal plugins.</p>
          
          <p>If you come from Rails or some other framework that handles all the
          database interaction for you, one of the best things you can do for
          your career is to learn relational theory and SQL. Read
          <a href="http://amzn.to/1Rm6WzL">a book by C. J. Date</a>.</p>
          
          <h3>The Unix Process Model</h3>
          
          <p>Understanding Unix processes helped me understand what's actually
          happening when I run a program. It's also helped me understand what
          exactly a web server is and what I'm doing when I write a web
          application. The book Advanced Linux Programming has
          <a href="http://advancedlinuxprogramming.com/alp-folder/alp-ch03-processes.pdf">a chapter on processes for free online</a>. Actually,
          the whole book is free.</p>
          
          <p>When you don't know about processes, programming is much harder and
          more mysterious. It's harder to understand performance, and it's
          harder to understand how programs interact with each other. If you
          ever feel a vague sense that you don't really get what's going when
          you run the apps you write, learning the process model will go a long
          way toward clearing things up.</p>
          
          <h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
          
          <p>Yeah, yeah, we've all heard the joke: "something something regular
          expressions, then you have two problems." Personally, I don't get it,
          because regular expressions are <em>seriously badass</em>. I remember going
          through O'Reilly's big fat regex book while I worked from 11pm till
          7am as a night auditor at a hotel when I was 18, and being blown away
          at how powerful they are. To say that we programmers deal with text
          all the time is so obvious, it's not even worth saying. Regular
          expressions are an essential tool,
          <a href="http://regexone.com/">and here's where you can learn to use them</a>.</p>
          
          <h3>Finite State Machines</h3>
          
          <p>Regular expressions are built as <em>finite state machines</em>. Here's
          <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/general-programming/finite-state-machines-and-regular-expressions-r3176">a great tutorial on FSMs</a>
          showing how to actually build a regular expression. It's extremely
          cool!</p>
          
          <p>I think FSMs are covered in computer science 101, but since I only
          went to college for a year and even then I studied works written a
          couple millennia before before the computer revolution, I didn't
          actually learn about them until about six years ago. My colleagues and
          I were having trouble with a mobile app - we needed the initialization
          process to happen in a particular way, and the logic for ensuring that
          was getting pretty tangled.</p>
          
          <p>Once we took the time to learn about FSMs, though, it was easy to
          express the process as a series of states and transitions. I've since
          found that most tricky UI code can be improved this way. Just a couple
          months ago I was having trouble building a typeahead element from
          scratch with <a href="http://hoplon.io/">hoplon</a>. Once I identified that the
          difficulty was in keeping track of all the possible states, it only
          took a few minutes drawing a state machine diagram and I was back on
          track.</p>
          
          <h3>Emotion Management</h3>
          
          <p>In my personal life I'm constantly learning about and practicing ways
          to manage emotions. This stems from both my personal aspiration to
          improve the lives of others and from the completely selfish reason
          that it helps me do good work. Emotion management is probably the most
          important meta-skill you can develop. I mean, emotions are at the core
          of who you are as a human being.</p>
          
          <p>The book <a href="http://amzn.to/1Rm6EZE">Non-Violent Communication</a> is an
          excellent resource for dealing with emotions. Also, my friend Alex
          Harms recently wrote
          <a href="http://empathetictechnicalleader.com/">a book specifically for technical people</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Those are my programming power tools - I hope you find them useful!</p>
