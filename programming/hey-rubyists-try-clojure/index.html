          </blockquote>
          
          <p>If you're a Rubyist itching to learn a new language, then I want to
          convince you (using only a minimum of mouth frothing and chair
          flipping) that Clojure's a great pick for you. Please excuse me if
          this article reeks of the glassy-eyed fanaticism of the true believer,
          but the fact is that I think Clojure is crazy stupid fun to use, and
          intellectually rewarding to boot.</p>
          
          <p>I fell in love with Ruby back in 2005, and since then only Clojure has
          been able to elicit the same level of affection. I think this is
          because Clojure has the same fundamental attributes that make Ruby so
          appealing: it's <em>simple</em>, it's <em>powerful</em>, and above all, it's
          <em>fun</em>. The rest of this love letter <em>cough</em> I mean, blog article, is
          about how Ruby and Clojure exhibit these attributes in very different
          ways, and how Clojure's different approach to computation makes it
          fascinating and rewarding to learn.</p>
          
          <p>My first exposure to Ruby was
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY">DHH's whoops-laden Ruby on Rails demo</a>.
          That video saved me from the Lovecraftian horror that was PHP
          circa 2005. You may have had a similar experience, with Ruby rescuing
          you from C++ or Java or COBOL or whatever.</p>
          
          <p>It's a vast understatement to say that, compared to PHP, Ruby is
          elegant. Whereas PHP seemed almost to strive for inconsistency, Ruby
          employs only a few, simple ideas: everything is an object, you advance
          your program by sending messagse to objects, and message dispatch is
          governed by a couple easily-understood rules.</p>
          
          <p>Clojure is also a very simple language. It wouldn't be a stretch to
          say that simplicity is one of the core tenets of the Clojure
          philosophy; its creator, Rich Hickey, has given a number of talks
          elaborating on what it means for something to be simple, including
          <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a>
          and
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdnJDO-xdg">Clojure, Made Simple</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Clojure's simplicity, however, takes a radically different form. In
          Clojure, you primarily care about two things: data and functions. You
          pass data to functions and get new data back. Yes, there's other
          interesting stuff like state management constructs and macros, just as
          there are other interesting aspects of Ruby like modules and
          blocks. But the heart of Clojure is so simple any eighth grade algebra
          student can understand it: hand some value to a function, and it hands
          you a new value back.</p>
          
          <p>"But wait a minute," you might be thinking, "You can't just pass data
          around like that. Haven't you read POODR? What about encapsulation?
          What if those functions mutate your data?"</p>
          
          <p>In Clojure, data is <em>immutable</em>. You can't change existing data, you
          can only derive new data; when you add 3 and 4, you don't change 3 or
          4 to make 7, you derive 7. If this sounds crazypants and impossible to
          work with, all I can do is assure you that it does work (and point you
          to this book I wrote available free online,
          <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a> which
          explains how) and hope that your intellectual curiosity will motivate
          you to explore this crazypants paradigm that lots of people seem to
          love. Here's a teaser: many of the problems addressed by
          object-oriented design simply aren't problems in Clojure. You don't
          have to care about inheritance vs. composition because behavior isn't
          chained to data. You don't have to care about data hiding because
          there's no risk that some object somewhere will silently change it.</p>
          
          <p>As a Rubyist, you know that simplicity buys you power, where power is
          defined as the ability to express computational ideas concisely. For
          example, Ruby's blocks allow you to write anonymous algorithms,
          something that's impossible in C.  Another example: Ruby's simple
          method dispatch scheme makes it easy for you to reason about and
          design robust programs. It lets you easily extend code and buys you
          reuse through multiple inheritance. Most enticingly, it lets you do
          metaprogramming.</p>
          
          <p>Clojure's simplicity also buys you power. As a Lisp, Clojure employs a
          syntax which just so happens to mirror the internal abstract syntax
          trees that represent Clojure code. I'm going to wave my hands a bit
          here and say that this lets you use <em>macros</em>, the most powerful
          metaprogramming tool available to any language. In the Ruby community,
          we like to talk about code that writes code; macros take this idea to
          a whole different level. It's not an exaggeration to say that Ruby's
          metaprogramming system provides only a subset of the capability
          provided by Lisp macros.</p>
          
          <p>Super duper hand wavy, I know, but the point is: if you like how
          powerful Ruby is, you will lose your flipping mind over how powerful
          Clojure is. Macros let you easily implement ideas from all corners of
          computer science. It's not an accident that Clojure has so many
          libraries that let you use different paradigms. There's <em>core.logic</em>
          for logic programming, <em>instaparse</em> for building parser generators,
          <em>core.typed</em> for haskell-ish typed programming, and much more.</p>
          
          <p>And macros aren't even the coolest part. I'll let you in on a secret:
          macros are the flashy, shiny bait that wild-eyed Clojurists lay out to
          ensnare curious programmers. Nay, even more powerful is Clojure's
          design of <em>programming to abstractions</em>. This design makes it
          incredibly easy to reuse your code and extend existing code. Of course
          I can't tell you <em>how</em> in the short space afforded by this digital
          outburst, but you'll grow as a programmer if you learn about it.</p>
          
          <p>These last two paragraphs also hint at what makes Clojure so dadgum
          fun. First, by learning Clojure you get introduced to one of the most
          loved and respected computational traditions, Lisp and the lambda
          calculus. It also has a clear philosophy, articulated by Rich Hickey,
          that will make you a better programmer. Not only that, other
          programming vistas become more readily accessible.</p>
          
          <p>Second, Clojure is a joy to write. Here's a quote from Matz (Ruby's
          creator) on his design philosophy:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>By using Ruby, I want to concentrate the things I do, not the
          magical rules of the language, like starting with public void
          something something something to say, "print hello world." I just
          want to say, "print this!" I don't want all the surrounding magic
          keywords. I just want to concentrate on the task. That's the basic
          idea. So I have tried to make Ruby code concise and succinct.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Clojure, likewise, is concise. It lets you focus on solving the
          problem at hand rather than figuring out the magic whatever. People
          are falling in love with Clojure, spending their nights and weekends
          learning it hacking with it, because the experience is its own reward.</p>
          
          <p>If you're looking to stretch yourself and explore more of what the
          world of programming has to offer, then I recommend Clojure to you
          with all of my crazed heart. Here are some resources for getting
          started:</p>
