          <h1>Techniques for Efficiently Learning Programming Languages</h1>
          <div class='date'>16 April 2017</div>
          <p>Learning programming languages is a skill: do it well and you'll
          experience one dopamine hit after another as you master something new;
          do it poorly and you'll feel constantly frustrated and even give
          up. What follows are the best techniques for learning programming
          languages that I've picked up over years of teaching programming by
          <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/">writing books</a> and
          <a href="http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/the-unofficial-guide-to-rich-hickeys-brain/">articles</a>,
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRq5UBx6cbA">doing talks</a>, and
          running
          <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/training/">a training course</a>. Many of
          these techniques are pulled from books explaining the latest research
          in efficient learning, and you can find those books (along with other
          great programming books) at
          <a href="http://www.communitypicks.com/r/learnprogramming">Community Picks: Learn Programming</a>.</p>
          
          <h2>Test Yourself Constantly to Defeat The Illusion of Competence</h2>
          
          <p>One of the <em>worst</em> ways to learn is to re-read or re-watch
          material. This kind of review gives you the <em>feeling</em> that you
          understand the topic covered because it seems like you're
          understanding the topic effortlessly. Researchers call this <em>the
          illusion of competence</em>.</p>
          
          <p>A significantly better approach (and one of the best techniques you
          can employ) is to <em>test yourself constantly</em>. Instead of re-reading
          what a function or class or object is, ask yourself to define these
          concepts or use them in a short program; force yourself to somehow
          demonstrate your understanding. This process often feels
          uncomfortable, but it's much more efficient at forming long term
          memories. You can take this one step further and <em>test yourself before
          you've covered the material</em> by, for example, attempting exercises
          before reading a chapter. Remarkably, this has also been shown aid
          memory formation.</p>
          
          <p>The impressive impact that testing has on learning is called <em>the
          testing effect</em>, and here are some specific ways you can take
          advantage of it:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Before reading a chapter or watching a video, try guessing at what
          you're about to learn and write it down.</li>
          <li>Try doing a chapter's exercises <em>before</em> reading the chapter.</li>
          <li>Always do exercises, even the hard ones. It's OK to give up on an
          exercise and come back to it later (or never, even), but at least
          try it. (More on this in the next section.)</li>
          <li>Read a short program and try to recreate it without looking at the
          original code. Or, go smaller and do this with a function.</li>
          <li>Immediately after learning a new concept like objects, classes,
          methods, or higher-order functions, write code that demonstrates
          that concept.</li>
          <li>Create diagrams that illustrate concepts, both in isolation and how
          they relate to each other.</li>
          <li>Blog about a concept you just learned. </li>
          <li>Try explaining the concept to a non-technical friend. (I did this a
          lot when writing <em>Clojure for the Brave and True</em>; being able to
          explain an idea in layman's terms forces you to understand the idea
          deeply.)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Many of these techniques boil down to <em>write some code!</em> With
          programming it's easy to believe we're learning a lot just by reading
          because programming is text-heavy and conceptual. But it's also a
          skill, and like any other skill you have to perform it to get
          better. Writing code is the best way to reveal your incorrect
          assumptions about programming. The faster you do that, the faster you
          can make corrections and improve.</p>
          
          <p>If you'd like to learn more about the testing effect, check out
          <a href="http://www.communitypicks.com/r/learnprogramming/s/17592186047889-make-it-stick-the-science-of-successful-learning"><em>make it stick: The Science of Successful Learning</em></a>.</p>
          
          <h2>Take Time to Unfocus</h2>
          
          <p>If you're stuck on a problem or don't understand something you just
          read, try taking a walk or even a shower -- anything to enter a
          relaxed, unfocused state of mind. It probably seems counterintuitive
          that one of the best ways to get unstuck is to stop trying for a
          little while, but it's true.</p>
          
          <p>The problem is that it's easy for us to put on mental blinders when
          we're focusing hard on a problem. I mean, that's pretty much what
          "focus" means. But by focusing hard, we're exploring only a small
          portion of the solution space. By unfocusing, our unconscious mind is
          able to explore and make connections across vast swaths of our
          experience.</p>
          
          <p>To me it's like when you're trying to find a destination on a paper
          map (remember those?). You can unconsciously become convinced that the
          city you're trying to reach <em>should be right here!</em> in the upper-left
          qudrant of the map, so you look at it over and over without
          success. Then you put the map down and take a deep breath and stare at
          nothing for a minute, and when you look at the map again the actual
          location jumps out at you immediately.</p>
          
          <p>We've all had the experience of having a sudden insight in the shower;
          now you have a slightly better understanding of why that happens, and
          you can employ the technique on purpose. Personally, I will actually
          take a shower if I'm stuck on something, and it's remarkable how well
          the technique works. And how clean I am.</p>
          
          <p>If you'd like to learn more about the focused and diffuse modes of
          thinking, check out

          <h2>Don't Waste Time Being Frustrated</h2>
          
          <p>Related to the last section: <em>don't waste time being frustrated with
          code</em>. Frustration leads us into doing stupid things like re-compiling
          a program or refreshing the browser with the hope that <em>this time it
          will be magically different</em>.</p>
          
          <p>Use frustration as a signal that there's a gap in your knowledge. Once
          you realize you're frustrated, it can help to take a step back and
          clearly identify the problem. If you've written some code that's not
          working, explicitly explain to yourself or someone else the result
          that you expected. Use the scientific method and develop a hypothesis
          for what's causing the unexpected behavior. Then test your
          hypothesis. Try again, and if a solution still eludes you, put the
          problem aside and come back to it later.</p>
          
          <p>I can't tell you how many times I've thrown my laptop in disgust over
          a seemingly unsolvable problem, only to look at it the next day and
          have an obvious solution pop into my head immediately. This happened
          last week, even.</p>
          
          <h2>Identify Which Programming Language Aspect You're Dealing With</h2>
          
          <p>Personally, I find it useful to keep in mind that when you're learning
          a programming language, you're actually learning four things:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>
          <em>How to write code</em>: syntax, semantics, and resource management</li>
          <li>The language's <em>paradigm</em>: object-oriented, functional, logic, etc.</li>
          <li>The <em>artifact ecosystem</em>: how to build and run executables and how
          to use libraries</li>
          <li>
          <em>Tooling</em>: editors, compilers, debuggers, linters</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>It's easy to get these four facets mixed up, with the unfortunate
          result that when you run into a problem you end up looking in
          completely the wrong place.</p>
          
          <p>Someone who's completely new to programming, for example, might start
          out by trying to build iOS apps. They might try to get their app
          running on a friend's phone, only to see some message about needing a
          developer certificate or whatever. This is part of the <em>artifact
          ecosystem</em>, but an inexperienced person might see this as a problem
          with <em>how to write code</em>. They might look at every line they wrote to
          figure out the problem, when the problem isn't with their code at all.</p>
          
          <p>I find it easier to learn a language if I tackle each of these aspects
          systematically, and in another blog post I'll present a general list
          of questions that need answering that should help you in learning any
          language.</p>
          
          <h2>Identify the Purpose, External Model, and Internal Model</h2>
          
          <p>Whenever you’re learning to use a new tool, its useful to identify its
          <em>purpose</em>, <em>external model</em> and <em>internal model</em>.</p>
          
          <p>When you understand a tool's purpose, your brain gets loaded with
          helpful contextual details that make it easier for you to assimilate
          new knowledge. It's like working on a puzzle: when you're able to look
          at a picture of the completed puzzle, it's a lot easier to fit the
          pieces together. This applies to languages themselves, and language
          libraries.</p>
          
          <p>A tool's external model is the interface it presents and the way it
          wants you to think about problem solving. Clojure’s external model is
          a Lisp that wants you to think about programming as mostly
          data-centric, immutable transformations. Ansible wants you to think of
          server provisioning in terms of defining the end state, rather than
          defining the steps you should take to get to that state.</p>
          
          <p>A tool's internal model is how it transforms the inputs to its
          interface into some lower-level abstraction. Clojure transforms Lisp
          into JVM bytecode. Ansible transforms task definitions into shell
          commands. In an ideal world, you wouldn’t have to understand the
          internal model, but in reality it’s almost always helpful to
          understand a tool's internal model because it gives you a unified
          perspective on what might seem like confusing or contradictory
          parts. When the double-helix model of DNA was discovered, for example,
          it helped scientists make sense of higher-level phenonema. My point, of
          course, is that this blog post is one of the greatest scientific
          achievements of all time.</p>
          
          <p>Tutorials often mix up a tool's external model and internal model in a
          way that’s confusing for learners; it's helpful to be aware of this so
          that you can easily identify when it's causing you frustration.</p>
          
          <h2>Spaced Repetition Helps You Remember</h2>
          
          <p>Spaced Repetition been proven to be one of the best ways to encode new
          information in long-term memory. The idea is to quiz yourself at
          ever-increasing time intervals to minimize memory decay using the
          fewest number of repetitions. The Guardian wrote a
          <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/23/spaced-repetition-a-hack-to-make-your-brain-store-information">great introductory article</a>.</p>
          
          <h2>Sleep and Exercise</h2>
          
          <p>Take care of your body! It's more than just a vehicle for your
          brain. If you want to be able to stay focused and learn efficiently,
          getting adequate sleep and exercise beats the pants off caffeine and
          energy drinks.</p>
