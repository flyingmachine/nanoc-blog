          <h1>Brave Clojure: Become a Better Programmer</h1>
          <div class='date'>22 March 2016</div>
          <p>Next week week I'm re-launching
          <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/">www.braveclojure.com</a> as <em>Brave
          Clojure</em>. The site will continue featuring <em>Clojure for the Brave and
          True</em>, but I'm expanding its scope a bit. Instead of just housing the
          book, the purpose of the site will be to help you and the people you
          cherish <em>become better programmers</em>.</p>
          
          <p>Like many other Clojurists, I fell in love with the language because
          learning it made me a better programmer. I started learning it because
          I was a bit bored and burnt out on the languages and tools I had been
          using. Ruby, Javascript, Objective-C weren't radically different from
          each other, and after using them for many years I felt like I was
          stagnating.</p>
          
          <p>But Clojure, with its radically different approach to computation (and
          those exotic parentheses) drew me out of my programming funk and made
          it fun to code again. It gave me new tools for thinking about
          software, and a concomitant feeling that I had an unfair advantage
          over my colleagues. So of course the subtitle of <em>Clojure for the
          Brave and True</em> is <em>learn the ultimate language and become a better
          programmer</em>.</p>
          
          <p>And, four years since I first encountered Rich Hickey's fractal hair,
          I still find Clojure to be an exceptional tool for becoming a better
          programmer. This is because Clojure is a fantastic tool for exploring
          programming concepts, and the talented community has created
          exceptional libraries for such diverse approaches as
          <a href="https://github.com/rbrush/clara-rules">forward-chaining rules engines</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/aengelberg/loco">constraint programming</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.logic">logic programming</a>, just to
          name a few.</p>
          
          <p>By learning a variety of programming concepts, you become a better
          programmer because you're better able to recognize what kind of
          problem you're working on and apply the right tools. To give just one
          example: when I'm working on complex UI widgets my work is always made
          easier if I model the widget using a finite state machine (FSM) - but
          I had to actually spend time learning what FSMs are and how to use
          them (those of you with comp sci degrees are probably chuckling at
          this).</p>
          
          <p>You may have started learning Clojure because you heard that
          functional programming, Lisp, and immutability can make your life
          easier, but the fun doesn't stop there! At Brave Clojure, I hope
          you'll continue using the ultimate language to explore the vast and
          infinitely fascinating world of computer programming with me.</p>
          
          <p>The first topic we'll explore is parallel programming. Here's the
          beginning of an ebook on the topic that I'm nearly finished with:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>Yes, it would be fair for you to describe my startup as the Google of
          palm reading. I don't know if you know this, but the fortune
          telling industry has no quality control standards. There is no Six
          Sigma of fortune telling. Sometimes it seems like these
          people are just <em>making things up</em>!</p>
          
          <p>We can do better. Did I say <em>we</em>? Yes! I want to you to embark on this
          startup journey with me. Lucky you! My - <em>our</em> - plan is to <em>disrupt</em>
          the field with an app that lets a user position their phone so that
          the camera <em>faces</em> their <em>palm</em> and takes a picture, then predicts the
          future. I call it: <em>iFacePalm</em>.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>And, uh, there's parallel programming in it.</p>
          
          <p>While I plan on spending most of my time helping you and all of your
          closest friends, enemies, and even frenemies become better programmers
          by writing about these big ideas, I'm also going to spend time
          covering practical Clojure topics like deployment and debugging.</p>
          
          <p>To make this happen, I'm working a (great) job only two days a week
          and spending the rest of the time on Brave Clojure, so I'll need to
          find a way to derive income from the site. I'm not sure yet what will
          be free and what won't. My dream is to make <em>all</em> the content
          available online for free. That's what gives me joy, and I think it's
          the best way to have a positive impact. Ideally, I would be supported
          in this endeavor through monthly donations, but I'll likely try
          different approaches over time.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, I've been putting together two sites to help you up your
          game:
          <a href="http://open-source.braveclojure.com/">Open Source Clojure Projects</a>,
          a directory of active projects, and
          <a href="https://clojurework.com/">Clojure Work</a>, the first Clojure-only job
          board. The latter is still in beta, and I'm going to officially
          release it and move it to https://jobs.braveclojure.com next week. The
          best way to get better at Clojure is to actually write Clojure, and
          working on real projects (and even getting paid to do so) is a great
          way to do that. Companies who buy job board ads will also be
          supporting me in making more content - hooray!</p>
          
          <p>If you get excited about learning more programming ideas, or learning
          to develop Clojure programs better, or getting paid cold hard cash to
          write your favorite language, then I cordially invite you to consider
          signing up for my newsletter, where I'll announce every release:</p>
          
          <form action="http://flyingmachinestudios.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=60763b0c4890c24bd055f32e6&amp;amp;id=0b40ffd1e1" class="validate" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" novalidate="" target="_blank">

          </form>
          
          <p>Writing <em>Clojure for the Brave and True</em> was one of the most rewarding
          experiences of my life in large part because I got to interact with so
          many kind, thoughtful, intelligent people. I look forward to your
          company as I embark on this new <em>chapter</em> of my journey!</p>
