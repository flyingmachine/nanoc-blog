                <p>It seems like there's a strong aversion to using frameworks in the Clojure community. Other languages might need frameworks, but not ours! Libraries all the way, baby!</p>

                <p>Rubyists enjoy Ruby because it's simple, powerful, and a joy to use. Clojure has all of those qualities, plus it employs a completely different paradigm that's crazy fun to learn. If you're looking to learn a new language, Clojure's a great choice.</p>

                <p><em>Clojure Applied</em> is a good choice for those looking to become intermediate Clojurists. It really shines in its coverage of testing and of decomposing your system into components. Besides that, it's filled with little gems from Java and the Clojure standard library.</p>

                <p>Build tools are known to inspire the entire gamut of emotions from bored impatience to Homeric rage (I'm looking at you, Grunt). Personally, I've never given them much thought; they've always seemed like tedious overhead, an unfortunate necessity for getting <em>real</em> work done. Boot is different.</p>

                <p>After many long months I've finished re-writing <a href='http://gratefulplace.com'>Grateful Place</a>. The site now uses Clojure as an API server, with Datomic for the database, Angular for the front end, and Vagrant and Ansible for provisioning and deployment. We'll dive into the code base, covering the most important parts of each component and how everything works together.</p>

                <p>I've been having a brain-bending good time reading An Introduction to Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculus. Using examples from that book, this article will walk you through the basics of λ calculus. We'll then look at the surprising, counterintuitive way that the λ calculus lets us represent conditional expressions and boolean operations &mdash; all with functions as the only values. It was a very different way of thinking for me, and exciting to learn. I hope it's exciting for you, too!</p>

                <p>If you're at all like me, the moment you got your first Clojure program running you belted out, "SOOO MUUUUUUUCH POOOOOOOWEEEEEEEER!" and thrust one or both fists into the air. Then, fifteen minutes later, you found yourself muttering things like "What's a maven?" and "Classpath what now?" and "What is Leiningen actually doing, anyway? Sure, those are the most handsome mustaches I ever laid eyes on, but can I really trust them?"</p>

                <p>Part of the excitement of working with Clojure is being exposed to Rich Hickey's thoughts on programming. Rich Hickey has a clear, consistent way of viewing fundamental programming concepts that I think any programmer would benefit from. Here is the beginning of my attempt to catalog Mr. Hickey's unique viewpoint.</p>

                <p>Noir has a helper function, url-for, which you can use to generate URL's when given a named route. The problem arises when you have two different views which need to have links to each other.</p>

                <p>The minimax algorithm is used to determine which moves a computer player makes in games like tic-tac-toe, checkers, othello, and chess. You can think of the algorithm as similar to the human thought process of saying, "OK, if I make this move, then my opponent can only make two moves, and each of those would let me win. So this is the right move to make."</p>

                <p>The learning curve for code libraries is often unnecessarily steep. I frequently feel that if the author had written better documentation, I'd be able to use his work much more quickly, or at least figure out that it's wrong for me and move on. I'm trying to write better documentation myself.</p>

There are a few reasons for that, though for now I'll only mention that I didn't like that the site existed in part to sell an iphone app and possibly future apps. Well, it turns out that I don't really care about overtly selling stuff. What I really want is a place to write about the pursuits I care about most.</p>

                <p>The world abounds with wacky models that help actual people actually overcome actual fear. Some people believe their obstacles are put there by God as tests for them to pass. Others believe that mortal life is a game played by immortal energy beings, just for the fun of it. And some folks believe that there is nothing more to life than what we see; when we die, that's the end, so we better make the most of it. Wacky!</p>

                <p>My first attempt to give myself super powers merely gave me sore palms. Riding in the back of my mother's beater as a five-year-old, I focused sunlight on the center of each hand using a magnifying glass likely found in a cereal box. After I was "charged up" I would point at trees, cars, fire hydrants, and other hapless objects and think to myself, "In five years, that thing's going to burst into flames."</p>

                <p>A few years ago I ordered DSL service. The DSL modem came with an ethernet cable, and one end was labeled "this end goes in your computer", and the other was labeled "this end goes in the modem." Obviously, it doesn't matter which end goes where, but the labels undoubtedly eliminated any possible confusion.</p>
